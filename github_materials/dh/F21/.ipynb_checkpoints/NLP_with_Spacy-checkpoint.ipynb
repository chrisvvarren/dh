       "in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and\n",
       "distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at\n",

       "the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\n",
       "altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\n",
       "another young man.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\n",
       "countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\n",
       "with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\n",
       "looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\n",
       "of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\n",
       "the report which was in general circulation within five minutes\n",
       "after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\n",
       "pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\n",
       "was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\n",
       "admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\n",
       "which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\n",
       "proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\n",
       "his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\n",
       "forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\n",
       "with his friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\n",
       "people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\n",
       "was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\n",
       "one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\n",
       "themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\n",
       "only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\n",
       "introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\n",
       "walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\n",
       "His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\n",
       "in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.\n",
       "Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\n",
       "his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\n",
       "having slighted one of her daughters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\n",
       "down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\n",
       "standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\n",
       "Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\n",
       "to join it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance. I hate to see you\n",
       "standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better\n",
       "dance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am\n",
       "particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this\n",
       "it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\n",
       "another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\n",
       "stand up with.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley, \"for a\n",
       "kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in\n",
       "my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\n",
       "uncommonly pretty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one\n",
       "of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\n",
       "dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Which do you mean?\" and turning round he looked for a moment at\n",
       "Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\n",
       "\"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no\n",
       "humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\n",
       "by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\n",
       "smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\n",
       "remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,\n",
       "however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\n",
       "playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.\n",
       "\n",
       "The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\n",
       "party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\n",
       "distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as\n",
       "her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's\n",
       "pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\n",
       "accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\n",
       "fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\n",
       "had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good\n",
       "spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\n",
       "were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With\n",
       "a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\n",
       "good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised\n",
       "such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on\n",
       "the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\n",
       "different story to hear.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\n",
       "delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.\n",
       "Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well\n",
       "she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\n",
       "her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her\n",
       "twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\n",
       "time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand\n",
       "up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\n",
       "can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\n",
       "down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\n",
       "asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,\n",
       "and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,\n",
       "and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\n",
       "\"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of\n",
       "his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first place!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively\n",
       "handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw\n",
       "anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\n",
       "Hurst's gown--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any\n",
       "description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\n",
       "of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\n",
       "exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\n",
       "suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\n",
       "all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\n",
       "him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\n",
       "great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my\n",
       "dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between\n",
       "us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What\n",
       "could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help\n",
       "seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman\n",
       "in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is\n",
       "very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a\n",
       "stupider person.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.\n",

       "good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of\n",
       "others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it\n",
       "everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the\n",
       "good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing\n",
       "of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,\n",

       "Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at\n",
       "the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\n",
       "quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,\n",
       "and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she\n",
       "was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine\n",
       "ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the\n",
       "power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\n",
       "conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the\n",

       "pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of\n",
       "associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect\n",
       "entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of\n",
       "a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply\n",

       "sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a\n",
       "good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\n",
       "who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\n",

       "married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\n",
       "his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\n",
       "age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation\n",
       "to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for\n",
       "half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal\n",
       "rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it\n",
       "immediately.\n",
       "\n",
       "Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of\n",
       "great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\n",

       "could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\n",
       "never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley\n",
       "had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.\n",
       "In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\n",
       "deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\n",
       "reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not\n",
       "inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\n",

       "to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt\n",
       "acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not\n",
       "conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a\n",
       "collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for\n",
       "none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received\n",
       "either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,\n",
       "but she smiled too much.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired\n",
       "her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one\n",
       "whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\n",

       "honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.\n",
       "The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a\n",
       "disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;\n",
       "and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house\n",
       "about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,\n",
       "where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,\n",
       "unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all\n",
       "the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him\n",
       "supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By\n",
       "nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.\n",

       "ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\n",
       "nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\n",
       "who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\n",
       "quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\n",
       "things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may\n",

       "was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on\n",
       "the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was\n",
       "found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,\n",
       "a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards\n",
       "the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest\n",
       "pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment\n",
       "of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;\n",
       "though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in\n",
       "all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It\n",
       "was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and\n",
       "to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference\n",
       "which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a\n",
       "way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\n",
       "was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane\n",
       "united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a\n",
       "uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions\n",
       "of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It may perhaps be pleasant,\" replied Charlotte, \"to be able to impose\n",
       "on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be\n",
       "so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill\n",
       "from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and\n",
       "it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in\n",
       "the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every\n",
       "attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\n",
       "_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\n",
       "very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\n",
       "encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_\n",
       "affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\n",
       "may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can\n",
       "perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to\n",
       "discover it too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal\n",
       "it, he must find it out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane\n",
       "meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they\n",
       "always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\n",
       "every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\n",
       "therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his\n",
       "attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for\n",
       "falling in love as much as she chooses.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your plan is a good one,\" replied Elizabeth, \"where nothing is in\n",

       "to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But\n",
       "these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,\n",
       "she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its\n",
       "reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four\n",
       "dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,\n",
       "and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite\n",
       "enough to make her understand his character.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might\n",
       "only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must\n",
       "remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four\n",
       "evenings may do a great deal.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they\n",
       "both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other\n",
       "leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Charlotte, \"I wish Jane success with all my heart; and\n",
       "if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a\n",
       "chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\n",
       "twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If\n",
       "the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or\n",
       "ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\n",
       "least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to\n",
       "have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as\n",
       "possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your\n",
       "life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not\n",
       "sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth\n",
       "was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some\n",
       "interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely\n",
       "allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the\n",
       "ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no\n",
       "sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly\n",
       "had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered\n",
       "uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To\n",
       "this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had\n",
       "detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry\n",
       "in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and\n",
       "pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those\n",
       "of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of\n",
       "this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made\n",
       "himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough\n",
       "to dance with.\n",
       "\n",
       "He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing\n",
       "with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so\n",
       "drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were\n",
       "assembled.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What does Mr. Darcy mean,\" said she to Charlotte, \"by listening to my\n",
       "conversation with Colonel Forster?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see\n",
       "what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by\n",
       "being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have\n",
       "any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such\n",
       "a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she\n",
       "turned to him and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly\n",
       "well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at\n",
       "Meryton?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You are severe on us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\" said Miss Lucas. \"I am going\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me\n",
       "to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken\n",
       "a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\n",
       "really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\n",
       "hearing the very best performers.\" On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,\n",
       "she added, \"Very well, if it must be so, it must.\" And gravely glancing\n",
       "at Mr. Darcy, \"There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of\n",

       "shall keep mine to swell my song.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\n",
       "or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that\n",
       "she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\n",
       "sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\n",
       "the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\n",
       "impatient for display.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\n",
       "application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\n",
       "manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\n",
       "had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\n",
       "much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\n",
       "end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\n",
       "Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,\n",
       "with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\n",
       "dancing at one end of the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\n",
       "passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\n",
       "much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was\n",
       "his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\n",

       "\n",
       "Sir William only smiled. \"Your friend performs delightfully,\" he\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond\n",
       "of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to\n",
       "rain; and then you must stay all night.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That would be a good scheme,\" said Elizabeth, \"if you were sure that\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,\n",

       "\"I had much rather go in the coach.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are\n",

       "\n",
       "\"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But if you have got them to-day,\" said Elizabeth, \"my mother's purpose\n",
       "will be answered.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses\n",
       "were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her\n",
       "mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a\n",
       "bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before\n",
       "it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\n",
       "delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\n",
       "Jane certainly could not come back.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet more than\n",
       "once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the\n",
       "next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\n",
       "contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\n",
       "brought the following note for Elizabeth:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n",
       "imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not\n",
       "hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.\n",
       "Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been\n",
       "to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the\n",
       "matter with me.--Yours, etc.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\n",
       "aloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\n",
       "should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\n",
       "Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling\n",
       "colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is\n",
       "all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though\n",
       "the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking\n",
       "was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such a\n",
       "thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\n",
       "there.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "horses?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing\n",
       "when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every\n",
       "impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\n",
       "exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and Lydia.\n",
       "Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\n",
       "together.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If we make haste,\" said Lydia, as they walked along, \"perhaps we may\n",
       "see something of Captain Carter before he goes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\n",
       "of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\n",
       "field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\n",
       "over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\n",
       "within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face\n",
       "glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were\n",
       "assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\n",
       "That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such\n",
       "dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\n",
       "Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\n",
       "for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\n",
       "brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there\n",
       "was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.\n",
       "Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\n",
       "brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as\n",
       "to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\n",
       "thinking only of his breakfast.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\n",
       "Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not\n",
       "well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\n",
       "immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\n",
       "alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed\n",
       "for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\n",
       "however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them\n",
       "together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the\n",
       "extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\n",
       "her.\n",
       "\n",
       "When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\n",
       "began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\n",
       "solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having\n",
       "examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught\n",
       "a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\n",
       "advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n",
       "was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\n",
       "ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were\n",
       "the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in\n",
       "fact, nothing to do elsewhere.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\n",
       "unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\n",
       "wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\n",
       "in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\n",
       "of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.\n",
       "Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to\n",
       "Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply\n",
       "of clothes.\n",

       "At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\n",
       "Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\n",
       "poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\n",
       "much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very\n",
       "favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\n",
       "this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\n",
       "shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\n",
       "being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\n",
       "indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored\n",
       "Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.\n",
       "\n",
       "Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\n",
       "regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\n",
       "attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling\n",
       "herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\n",
       "others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\n",
       "engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\n",
       "Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\n",
       "eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain\n",
       "dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\n",
       "began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\n",
       "pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;\n",
       "she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the\n",
       "same, and added:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\n",
       "walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\n",
       "looked almost wild.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\n",
       "nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\n",
       "country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\n",
       "in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to\n",
       "hide it not doing its office.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,\" said Bingley; \"but this was\n",
       "all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably\n",
       "well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\n",
       "escaped my notice.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\n",
       "inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such\n",
       "an exhibition.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\n",
       "above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by\n",
       "it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\n",
       "a most country-town indifference to decorum.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\n",
       "Bingley.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \"that\n",
       "this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all,\" he replied; \"they were brightened by the exercise.\" A\n",
       "short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have a excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very\n",
       "sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with\n",
       "such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is\n",
       "no chance of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on\n",
       "Meryton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is capital,\" added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\n",
       "would not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\n",
       "consideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\n",
       "hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\n",
       "their dear friend's vulgar relations.\n",
       "\n",
       "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on\n",
       "leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\n",
       "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\n",
       "late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and\n",
       "when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\n",
       "downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole\n",
       "party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\n",
       "them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the\n",
       "excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay\n",
       "below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\n",
       "reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I am\n",
       "_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\n",
       "I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the\n",
       "table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\n",
       "others--all that his library afforded.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\n",
       "credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more\n",
       "than I ever looked into.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\n",
       "in the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\n",

       "Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It ought to be good,\" he replied, \"it has been the work of many\n",
       "generations.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying\n",
       "books.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\n",
       "these.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\n",
       "that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\n",
       "half as delightful as Pemberley.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish it may.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\n",
       "neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\n",
       "finer county in England than Derbyshire.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\n",
       "Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very\n",
       "little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew\n",
       "near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his\n",
       "eldest sister, to observe the game.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley; \"will\n",
       "she be as tall as I am?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\n",
       "rather taller.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\n",
       "so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished\n",
       "for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\n",
       "to be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\n",
       "net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure\n",
       "I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being\n",
       "informed that she was very accomplished.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\n",
       "too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\n",
       "otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very\n",
       "far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\n",
       "cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my\n",
       "acquaintance, that are really accomplished.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\n",
       "idea of an accomplished woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\n",
       "esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\n",
       "with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\n",
       "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides\n",
       "all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\n",
       "walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\n",
       "will be but half-deserved.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy, \"and to all this she must\n",
       "yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by\n",
       "extensive reading.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\n",
       "implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\n",
       "answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\n",
       "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\n",
       "conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\n",
       "room.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Elizabeth Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,\n",
       "\"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the\n",
       "other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it\n",
       "succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n",
       "\"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\n",

       "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\n",
       "be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\n",
       "eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\n",
       "unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\n",

       "were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\n",
       "declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\n",
       "however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief\n",
       "to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\n",

       "Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the\n",
       "morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\n",
       "inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\n",
       "and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\n",
       "sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\n",
       "note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\n",
       "own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and\n",
       "its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\n",
       "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\n",
       "\n",
       "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\n",
       "very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\n",
       "not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\n",
       "restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\n",
       "would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried\n",
       "home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\n",
       "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\n",
       "Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughter all\n",
       "attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\n",
       "that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed I have, sir,\" was her answer. \"She is a great deal too ill to be\n",
       "moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\n",
       "a little longer on your kindness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Removed!\" cried Bingley. \"It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\n",
       "sure, will not hear of her removal.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may depend upon it, Madam,\" said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\n",
       "\"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she\n",
       "remains with us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure,\" she added, \"if it was not for such good friends I do not\n",
       "know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers\n",
       "a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\n",
       "always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\n",
       "temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are\n",
       "nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a\n",
       "charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the\n",
       "country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it\n",
       "in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,\" replied he; \"and therefore if I\n",
       "should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\n",
       "minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\" said Elizabeth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You begin to comprehend me, do you?\" cried he, turning towards her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\n",
       "through I am afraid is pitiful.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate\n",
       "character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in\n",
       "the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley immediately, \"that you were a\n",
       "studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\n",
       "least that advantage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but a few subjects for\n",
       "such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\n",
       "unvarying society.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\n",
       "observed in them for ever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, indeed,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning\n",
       "a country neighbourhood. \"I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\n",
       "going on in the country as in town.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\n",
       "turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\n",
       "victory over him, continued her triumph.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\n",
       "my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\n",
       "pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it;\n",
       "and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their\n",
       "advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that\n",
       "gentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\n",
       "at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\n",
       "mother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\n",
       "such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,\n",
       "which you must acknowledge to be true.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting\n",
       "with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\n",
       "neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\n",
       "countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards\n",
       "Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\n",
       "saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if\n",
       "Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\n",
       "William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So\n",
       "genteel and easy! He had always something to say to everybody. _That_\n",
       "is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\n",
       "important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did Charlotte dine with you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For\n",
       "my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;\n",
       "_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to\n",
       "judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,\n",
       "I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think\n",
       "Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She seems a very pleasant young woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself\n",
       "has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast\n",
       "of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody\n",
       "better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own\n",
       "partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother\n",
       "Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was\n",
       "sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he\n",
       "did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses\n",
       "on her, and very pretty they were.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And so ended his affection,\" said Elizabeth impatiently. \"There has\n",
       "been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first\n",
       "discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\" said Darcy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is\n",
       "strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\n",
       "am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\n",
       "tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\n",
       "speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\n",
       "Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\n",
       "unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\n",
       "civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part\n",
       "indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\n",
       "soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\n",
       "her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\n",
       "each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the\n",
       "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\n",
       "into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\n",
       "and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\n",
       "affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\n",
       "animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\n",
       "attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own\n",
       "easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very\n",
       "equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and\n",
       "abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most\n",
       "shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this\n",
       "sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when\n",
       "your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\n",
       "the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Lydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh! yes--it would be much better to\n",
       "wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter\n",
       "would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\n",
       "added, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\n",
       "Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned\n",
       "instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the\n",
       "remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\n",

       "writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\n",
       "thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\n",
       "think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\n",
       "quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any\n",
       "attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield\n",
       "you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\n",
       "panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very\n",

       "undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\n",

       "I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\n",

       "dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\n",
       "mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better\n",
       "stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not\n",
       "go--and at another word, might stay a month.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\n",

       "more than he did himself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\n",
       "friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\n",
       "afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\n",
       "intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a\n",
       "circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\n",

       "\n",

       "but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\n",
       "stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\n",
       "that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\n",
       "the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\n",
       "one argument in favour of its propriety.\"\n",

       "either.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\n",
       "one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\n",
       "one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\n",
       "supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\n",
       "circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\n",
       "thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,\n",
       "where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\n",

       "between the parties?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\n",
       "forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more\n",
       "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\n",
       "you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\n",

       "on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\n",
       "admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her\n",
       "because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,\n",
       "however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something\n",
       "more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" said she, \"I heard you before, but I could not immediately\n",

       "had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\n",

       "drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many\n",

       "as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.\n",
       "Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an\n",

       "at their acquaintance with spirit.\n",
       "\n",
       "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\n",
       "Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had\n",
       "something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\n",
       "himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also\n",
       "made her a slight bow, and said he was \"very glad;\" but diffuseness\n",
       "and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and\n",
       "attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\n",
       "should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire\n",
       "to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from\n",
       "the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone\n",
       "else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\n",

       "When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\n",

       "petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and\n",
       "the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\n",
       "Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the\n",
       "sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;\n",
       "and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets\n",

       "\n",
       "Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\n",

       "was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\n",
       "could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\n",

       "amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\n",
       "second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant\n",
       "it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no\n",
       "enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\n",

       "\n",
       "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\n",

       "the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are\n",
       "not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\n",
       "pleasure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\n",
       "carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\n",
       "tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\n",
       "more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of\n",
       "the day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be\n",
       "near so much like a ball.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked\n",
       "about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but\n",
       "Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In\n",
       "the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,\n",
       "turning to Elizabeth, said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\n",
       "turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\n",
       "long in one attitude.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\n",
       "succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked\n",
       "up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\n",
       "Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\n",
       "directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\n",
       "he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\n",
       "the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\n",
       "interfere. \"What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\n",
       "meaning?\"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all,\" was her answer; \"but depend upon it, he means to be severe\n",
       "on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing\n",
       "about it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\n",
       "anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his\n",
       "two motives.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,\" said he, as soon\n",
       "as she allowed him to speak. \"You either choose this method of passing\n",
       "the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret\n",
       "affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\n",
       "appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be\n",
       "completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better\n",
       "as I sit by the fire.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! shocking!\" cried Miss Bingley. \"I never heard anything so\n",
       "abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,\" said Elizabeth. \"We\n",
       "can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\n",
       "as you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has\n",
       "not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of\n",
       "mind! No, no--feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will\n",
       "not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a\n",
       "subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!\" cried Elizabeth. \"That is an\n",
       "uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\n",
       "be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a\n",
       "laugh.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me more credit than can be.\n",

       "life is a joke.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth--\"there are such people, but I hope I\n",
       "am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.\n",
       "Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,\n",
       "and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely\n",
       "what you are without.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study\n",
       "of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\n",
       "but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\n",
       "for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the\n",
       "convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of other\n",
       "so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings\n",
       "are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\n",

       "forever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_That_ is a failing indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\n",

       "of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been\n",
       "suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\n",
       "in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\n",
       "ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were\n",

       "glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily\n",
       "assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything\n",

       "him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some\n",
       "deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the\n",

       "\n",

       "at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\n",

       "one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\n",
       "Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such\n",

       "always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\n",
       "Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the\n",
       "house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\n",
       "was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\n",
       "walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\n",
       "than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.\n",
       "\n",
       "In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\n",
       "cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of\n",
       "the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were\n",
       "immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and\n",
       "nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in\n",
       "a shop window, could recall them.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\n",
       "they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\n",
       "with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was\n",
       "the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came\n",
       "to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the\n",
       "stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,\n",
       "determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under\n",
       "pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\n",
       "had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\n",
       "reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\n",
       "permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\n",
       "him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\n",
       "commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the\n",
       "young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.\n",
       "His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\n",
       "beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.\n",
       "The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\n",
       "of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\n",
       "unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\n",
       "very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\n",
       "and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the\n",
       "ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\n",
       "began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\n",
       "Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to\n",
       "Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated\n",
       "it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\n",
       "on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\n",
       "stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\n",
       "looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.\n",
       "Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,\n",
       "after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\n",
       "deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to\n",
       "imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.\n",
       "\n",
       "In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\n",
       "passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\n",
       "Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\n",
       "pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of\n",
       "Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\n",
       "invitation.\n",

       "Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\n",
       "from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was\n",
       "eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\n",
       "their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing\n",
       "about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the\n",
       "street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to\n",
       "Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility\n",
       "was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She\n",
       "received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\n",
       "as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\n",
       "acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,\n",
       "however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\n",
       "introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an\n",
       "excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon\n",
       "put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,\n",
       "however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that\n",
       "Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\n",
       "lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the\n",
       "last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\n",
       "Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the\n",
       "occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the\n",
       "officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\n",
       "disagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses\n",
       "the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\n",
       "Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\n",
       "would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\n",
       "protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\n",
       "tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\n",
       "delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\n",
       "Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\n",
       "with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\n",
       "between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either\n",
       "or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain\n",

       "Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring\n",
       "Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady\n",
       "Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;\n",
       "for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even\n",
       "pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\n",
       "utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\n",
       "attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\n",

       "The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\n",

       "told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not\n",
       "even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\n",
       "relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one. A clear\n",

       "capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\n",
       "seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\n",
       "yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly. \"I have\n",
       "spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\n",
       "disagreeable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\n",
       "agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\n",
       "too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_\n",
       "to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\n",
       "astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\n",
       "anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\n",
       "the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\n",
       "Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\n",
       "him more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\n",
       "interruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\n",
       "their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\n",
       "world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\n",
       "high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\n",
       "ill-tempered man.\" Wickham only shook his head.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\n",
       "likely to be in this country much longer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\n",
       "was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\n",
       "not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\n",
       "wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\n",
       "and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\n",
       "avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\n",
       "of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\n",
       "is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\n",
       "that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\n",
       "be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\n",
       "a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\n",
       "scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\n",
       "everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\n",
       "memory of his father.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\n",
       "all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\n",
       "neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\n",
       "he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\n",
       "intelligible gallantry.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\n",
       "\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be\n",
       "a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\n",
       "further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\n",
       "attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.\n",
       "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\n",
       "my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\n",
       "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\n",
       "now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\n",
       "was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\n",
       "possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\n",
       "were speaking of just now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\n",
       "living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\n",
       "I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\n",
       "and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\n",
       "elsewhere.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be? How could his\n",
       "will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\n",
       "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\n",
       "intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\n",
       "conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\n",
       "to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain\n",
       "it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\n",
       "of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\n",
       "less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\n",
       "anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\n",
       "I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can\n",
       "recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort\n",
       "of men, and that he hates me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\n",
       "can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\n",
       "ever as he expressed them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive? What can\n",
       "have induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\n",
       "attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\n",
       "less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\n",
       "attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\n",
       "not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\n",
       "of preference which was often given me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\n",
       "him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be\n",
       "despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\n",
       "descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\n",
       "this.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_\n",
       "remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\n",
       "his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition\n",

       "sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_\n",
       "father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\n",
       "appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\n",
       "use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\n",
       "Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\n",
       "intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\n",
       "be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,\n",
       "and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\n",
       "voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\n",
       "be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I wonder that the very\n",
       "pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better\n",
       "motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\n",
       "dishonesty I must call it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It _is_ wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions may\n",
       "be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has\n",
       "connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are\n",
       "none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\n",
       "impulses even than pride.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\n",
       "freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\n",
       "poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\n",
       "his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,\n",
       "to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\n",
       "Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\n",
       "which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\n",
       "careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\n",
       "as the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\n",
       "speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very\n",
       "proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\n",
       "of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\n",
       "nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\n",
       "and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her\n",
       "home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\n",
       "education.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\n",
       "help reverting once more to the first, and saying:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,\n",
       "who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\n",
       "be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\n",
       "know Mr. Bingley?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.\n",
       "Darcy is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\n",
       "want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\n",
       "his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\n",
       "a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His\n",
       "pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\n",
       "sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\n",
       "for fortune and figure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\n",
       "the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\n",
       "Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success was\n",
       "made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every\n",
       "point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\n",
       "he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\n",
       "importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\n",
       "that she would not make herself uneasy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\n",
       "card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I\n",
       "am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\n",
       "are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\n",

       "little matters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\n",
       "were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\n",

       "\n",
       "This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\n",

       "I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\n",
       "not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\n",
       "her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\n",
       "reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\n",
       "she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\n",
       "her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\n",

       "put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\n",
       "Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise\n",
       "of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to\n",
       "everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\n",
       "gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could\n",
       "think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\n",
       "the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\n",
       "as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia\n",

       "fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\n",
       "Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\n",
       "at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\n",

       "veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The\n",
       "possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\n",
       "interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\n",

       "it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such\n",
       "a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is\n",
       "impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\n",

       "\n",

       "asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To\n",
       "the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet\n",
       "as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\n",

       "by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\n",
       "ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\n",
       "society of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and\n",
       "Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\n",

       "and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\n",
       "less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they\n",
       "each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\n",
       "he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\n",

       "he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\n",
       "amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\n",
       "scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\n",

       "quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\n",
       "The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\n",

       "they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\n",
       "apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\n",

       "\n",
       "She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\n",
       "Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances\n",

       "be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\n",
       "some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\n",
       "silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\n",
       "with:--\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked\n",
       "about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\n",

       "\n",
       "He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\n",
       "said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may\n",
       "observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But\n",
       "_now_ we may be silent.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\n",
       "entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\n",
       "_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\n",
       "trouble of saying as little as possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\n",
       "imagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\n",
       "similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\n",
       "taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\n",
       "something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\n",
       "posterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\n",
       "said he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\n",
       "think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\n",
       "the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\n",
       "walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\n",
       "the temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\n",
       "been forming a new acquaintance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\n",
       "features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\n",
       "for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\n",
       "constrained manner said, \"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\n",
       "as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\n",
       "_retaining_ them, is less certain.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\n",
       "with emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\n",
       "his life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\n",
       "that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\n",
       "through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\n",
       "his dancing and his partner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very\n",
       "superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\n",
       "first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\n",
       "disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\n",
       "especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\n",
       "her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then\n",
       "flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You\n",
       "will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\n",
       "young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\n",
       "William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\n",
       "eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\n",
       "Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\n",
       "he turned to his partner, and said, \"Sir William's interruption has made\n",
       "me forget what we were talking of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\n",
       "interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.\n",
       "We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\n",
       "are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\n",
       "feelings.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\n",
       "no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\n",
       "something else.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\n",
       "with a look of doubt.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\n",
       "thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\n",
       "by her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\n",
       "that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\n",
       "unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\n",
       "created_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\n",
       "to be secure of judging properly at first.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\n",
       "to shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what is your success?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\n",
       "accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may vary\n",
       "greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\n",
       "not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\n",
       "fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\n",
       "opportunity.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\n",
       "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\n",
       "silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,\n",
       "for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards\n",
       "her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\n",
       "another.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\n",
       "with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!\n",
       "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\n",
       "questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\n",
       "his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\n",
       "Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\n",
       "give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\n",
       "using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\n",
       "always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\n",
       "Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but\n",
       "I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\n",
       "cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\n",
       "thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\n",
       "the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\n",
       "out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\n",
       "thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,\n",
       "Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,\n",
       "considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\n",
       "Elizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\n",
       "than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can\n",
       "assure you, he informed me himself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\n",
       "\"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Insolent girl!\" said Elizabeth to herself. \"You are much mistaken\n",
       "if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\n",
       "nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\n",
       "Darcy.\" She then sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make\n",
       "inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\n",
       "such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\n",
       "marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\n",
       "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\n",
       "Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\n",
       "before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\n",
       "sister's, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\n",
       "been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\n",
       "you may be sure of my pardon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\n",
       "satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\n",
       "his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\n",
       "principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\n",
       "the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\n",
       "Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\n",
       "received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,\n",
       "Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has\n",
       "been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\n",
       "satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\n",
       "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\n",
       "him _conditionally_ only.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\n",
       "\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\n",
       "Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\n",
       "since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\n",
       "the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\n",
       "both gentlemen as I did before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\n",
       "which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\n",
       "delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\n",
       "Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\n",
       "in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\n",
       "to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\n",
       "partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\n",
       "and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\n",
       "to make a most important discovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\n",
       "in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the\n",
       "gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\n",
       "the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\n",
       "Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have\n",
       "thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\n",
       "Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\n",
       "in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\n",
       "do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\n",
       "ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\n",
       "I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to\n",
       "assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\n",
       "that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\n",
       "as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\n",
       "it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\n",
       "side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\n",
       "consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her\n",
       "with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\n",
       "ceased speaking, replied thus:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\n",
       "your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\n",
       "understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\n",
       "difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\n",
       "and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\n",
       "I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\n",
       "the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\n",
       "behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to\n",
       "follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\n",
       "perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to\n",
       "profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\n",
       "guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\n",
       "education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\n",
       "lady like yourself.\" And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\n",
       "astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced\n",
       "his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\n",
       "it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\n",
       "words \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\" It vexed\n",
       "her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\n",
       "with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\n",
       "to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,\n",
       "was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\n",
       "abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\n",
       "end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.\n",
       "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\n",
       "reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\n",
       "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\n",
       "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\n",
       "certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\n",
       "handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\n",
       "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\n",
       "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\n",
       "made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in\n",
       "that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\n",
       "could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\n",
       "endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts\n",
       "she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\n",
       "venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to\n",
       "supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\n",
       "placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\n",
       "that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\n",
       "openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\n",
       "be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\n",
       "seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\n",
       "match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\n",
       "three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\n",
       "then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\n",
       "Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\n",
       "she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\n",
       "daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\n",
       "other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\n",
       "able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\n",
       "she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was\n",
       "necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\n",
       "such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She\n",
       "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\n",
       "fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\n",
       "chance of it.\n",
       "\n",
       "In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\n",
       "words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\n",
       "whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\n",
       "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\n",
       "mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am\n",
       "sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\n",
       "nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you\n",
       "to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\n",
       "so doing!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\n",
       "talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and\n",
       "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\n",
       "glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\n",
       "she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\n",
       "convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\n",
       "of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\n",
       "steady gravity.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\n",
       "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\n",
       "likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\n",
       "chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of\n",
       "tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\n",
       "she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n",
       "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\n",
       "entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\n",
       "but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\n",
       "exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's\n",
       "eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\n",
       "progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\n",
       "ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\n",
       "of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\n",
       "favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\n",
       "Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\n",
       "weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at\n",
       "Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\n",
       "Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\n",
       "of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\n",
       "imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\n",
       "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\n",
       "and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\n",
       "extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other\n",
       "young ladies have time to exhibit.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\n",
       "Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\n",
       "her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\n",
       "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\n",
       "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\n",
       "compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\n",
       "to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\n",
       "to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\n",
       "rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make\n",
       "such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\n",
       "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\n",
       "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\n",
       "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\n",
       "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\n",
       "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody,\n",
       "especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit\n",
       "him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\n",
       "occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\n",
       "family.\" And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\n",
       "been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many\n",
       "smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\n",
       "wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\n",
       "and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\n",
       "clever, good kind of young man.\n",
       "\n",
       "To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\n",
       "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\n",
       "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\n",
       "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\n",
       "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\n",
       "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\n",
       "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\n",
       "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\n",
       "and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\n",
       "gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\n",
       "Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\n",
       "he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\n",
       "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\n",
       "somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.\n",
       "He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\n",
       "that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\n",
       "her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\n",
       "the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed\n",
       "her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\n",
       "good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\n",
       "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\n",
       "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\n",
       "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\n",
       "it.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\n",
       "a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\n",
       "an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\n",
       "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\n",
       "sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\n",
       "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\n",
       "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\n",
       "languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\n",
       "long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\n",
       "sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\n",
       "politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\n",
       "nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\n",
       "Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\n",
       "rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\n",
       "silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\n",
       "much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\n",
       "how tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\n",
       "\n",
       "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\n",
       "civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\n",
       "addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\n",
       "would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\n",
       "the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\n",
       "and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\n",
       "her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\n",
       "day for a short time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\n",
       "delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\n",
       "settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\n",
       "see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\n",
       "months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\n",
       "with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\n",
       "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\n",
       "man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\n",
       "was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\n",
       "every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\n",
       "of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\n",
       "add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\n",
       "to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\n",
       "recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\n",
       "patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\n",

       "arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\n",
       "must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose\n",
       "a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\n",
       "useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\n",
       "income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\n",
       "you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\n",
       "way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\n",
       "and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\n",
       "advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\n",
       "anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\n",
       "acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\n",
       "respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n",
       "intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\n",
       "were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\n",
       "can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\n",
       "being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\n",
       "father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\n",
       "myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\n",
       "the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\n",
       "event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\n",
       "be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\n",
       "I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\n",
       "remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\n",
       "violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\n",
       "shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\n",
       "aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\n",
       "in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's\n",
       "decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\n",
       "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\n",
       "no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried. \"You forget that I have made no\n",

       "the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\n",

       "decline them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\n",

       "man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\n",
       "favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\n",
       "third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\n",
       "said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\n",
       "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\n",
       "one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\n",
       "daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\n",
       "time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\n",
       "happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\n",
       "could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\n",
       "am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\n",
       "situation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\n",
       "very gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\n",
       "disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of\n",
       "seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\n",
       "modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You\n",
       "must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\n",
       "of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\n",
       "refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\n",
       "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\n",
       "feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\n",
       "estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may\n",
       "be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she\n",
       "thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\n",
       "addressed her:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\n",
       "shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\n",
       "me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\n",
       "know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\n",
       "the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\n",
       "encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\n",
       "female character.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\n",
       "exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\n",
       "of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\n",
       "to convince you of its being one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\n",
       "refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for\n",
       "believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\n",
       "unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\n",
       "be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\n",
       "with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\n",
       "circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\n",
       "consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\n",
       "means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\n",
       "portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\n",
       "the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must\n",
       "therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\n",
       "I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\n",
       "suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\n",

       "again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\n",
       "to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n",
       "forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\n",

       "mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly\n",
       "expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\n",
       "but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke\n",

       "them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to\n",
       "her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\n",

       "\n",
       "Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\n",

       "Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw\n",

       "cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety\n",
       "on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\n",
       "sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\n",
       "invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room,\n",

       "correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these highflown\n",
       "expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\n",

       "nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\n",

       "that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\n",
       "in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\n",
       "I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\n",
       "my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\n",
       "tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\n",
       "degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\n",

       "\n",
       "\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\n",
       "representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\n",
       "foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\n",
       "anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving\n",
       "herself.\"\n",

       "lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\n",

       "morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n",
       "himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\n",
       "from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\n",
       "conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\n",
       "till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\n",
       "secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\n",
       "he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.\n",
       "His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\n",
       "perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\n",
       "instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\n",
       "she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n",
       "\n",
       "In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,\n",
       "everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\n",
       "they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\n",
       "was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\n",
       "be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\n",
       "his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\n",
       "guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\n",
       "continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure\n",
       "and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\n",
       "establishment were gained.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\n",
       "and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present\n",
       "circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\n",
       "they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\n",
       "exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\n",
       "interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\n",
       "Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\n",
       "opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\n",
       "Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\n",
       "should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,\n",
       "were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes\n",
       "of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\n",
       "done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\n",
       "dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had\n",
       "gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were\n",
       "in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\n",
       "nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\n",
       "be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly\n",
       "either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\n",
       "the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\n",
       "and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\n",
       "preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at\n",
       "the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all\n",
       "the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business\n",
       "was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\n",
       "she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,\n",
       "and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\n",
       "shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\n",
       "to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\n",
       "when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\n",
       "passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\n",
       "dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\n",
       "curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\n",
       "questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\n",
       "at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\n",
       "publish his prosperous love.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\n",
       "family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\n",
       "for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,\n",
       "said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever\n",
       "his engagements might allow him to visit them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\n",
       "gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\n",
       "you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\n",
       "possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\n",
       "so speedy a return, immediately said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my\n",
       "good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\n",
       "offending your patroness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you\n",
       "for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\n",
       "material a step without her ladyship's concurrence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her\n",
       "displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\n",
       "again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\n",
       "and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\n",
       "affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\n",
       "from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\n",
       "regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though\n",
       "my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\n",
       "take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\n",
       "cousin Elizabeth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\n",
       "surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to\n",
       "understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\n",
       "younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.\n",
       "She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\n",
       "a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\n",
       "means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\n",
       "and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\n",
       "agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this\n",
       "kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\n",
       "private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\n",
       "\n",
       "The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\n",
       "friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\n",
       "that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\n",
       "possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\n",
       "consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\n",
       "she could not help crying out:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\n",
       "story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\n",
       "reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\n",
       "her composure, and calmly replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible\n",
       "that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\n",
       "because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\n",
       "for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\n",
       "their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\n",
       "all imaginable happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte. \"You must be surprised,\n",
       "very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\n",
       "you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\n",
       "satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never\n",
       "was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\n",
       "character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\n",
       "chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\n",
       "entering the marriage state.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an awkward pause,\n",
       "they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\n",
       "longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.\n",
       "It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\n",
       "unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\n",
       "of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\n",
       "accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was\n",
       "not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\n",
       "that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\n",
       "feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\n",
       "most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\n",
       "and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\n",
       "was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\n",
       "chosen.\n",

       "to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,\n",
       "been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\n",
       "whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as\n",

       "nothing.\n",

       "no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\n",
       "acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,\n",
       "and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A\n",

       "\n",
       "With a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately,\n",
       "that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\n",
       "has done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Jane!\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness\n",

       "\n",

       "the praise on her sister's warm affection.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\n",
       "world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want\n",
       "to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not\n",
       "be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\n",
       "privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\n",
       "whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\n",
       "of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\n",
       "my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\n",
       "little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\n",
       "sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the\n",

       "of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and\n",
       "Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a\n",
       "large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\n",

       "understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\n",
       "conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as\n",
       "I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him\n",
       "cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\n",
       "it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\n",
       "change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\n",

       "mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\n",
       "you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\n",
       "saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\n",
       "ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\n",
       "to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane;\n",

       "objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try\n",
       "to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\n",

       "be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.\"\n",

       "a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may\n",
       "perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\n",
       "would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\n",

       "hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\n",

       "and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the\n",
       "sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters\n",

       "curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would\n",

       "be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte\n",
       "expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She\n",
       "wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing\n",
       "which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and\n",

       "her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much\n",
       "engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that\n",
       "Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was\n",

       "\n",
       "Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to\n",

       "blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning\n",
       "for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\n",
       "visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,\n",
       "the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no\n",
       "longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will\n",
       "prove what she felt.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her\n",
       "better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been\n",
       "entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,\n",
       "though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I\n",
       "still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was\n",
       "as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for\n",
       "wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to\n",
       "happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not\n",
       "return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I\n",
       "receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that\n",
       "she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not\n",
       "calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was\n",
       "in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was\n",
       "perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,\n",
       "though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out\n",
       "as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on\n",
       "her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting\n",
       "wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the\n",
       "cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know\n",
       "this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily\n",
       "account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to\n",
       "his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and\n",
       "amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,\n",
       "because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.\n",

       "herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she\n",
       "wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I\n",
       "cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should\n",
       "be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity\n",
       "in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,\n",
       "and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the\n",
       "invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very\n",
       "soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield\n",
       "again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better\n",
       "not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts\n",

       "This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she\n",
       "considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\n",
       "All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\n",
       "even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on\n",

       "concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth\n",
       "had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to\n",
       "herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\n",
       "he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\n",
       "see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.\n",
       "Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied\n",
       "with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune\n",
       "permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most\n",

       "agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than\n",
       "in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.\n",
       "Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to\n",
       "suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was\n",
       "ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very\n",

       "and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and\n",
       "wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial\n",
       "towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find\n",
       "out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to\n",
       "think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My\n",

       "going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan\n",
       "and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure\n",
       "as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing\n",
       "Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There\n",
       "was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such\n",
       "uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change\n",

       "they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\n",
       "looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\n",
       "lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\n",
       "whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to\n",
       "wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen\n",
       "her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\n",
       "kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\n",
       "shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\n",

       "Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had\n",
       "seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,\n",
       "and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in\n",
       "search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.\n",
       "The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth\n",
       "smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the\n",
       "road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,\n",
       "everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte\n",
       "appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which\n",
       "led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\n",
       "the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\n",
       "at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\n",
       "liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\n",
       "coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\n",
       "instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;\n",
       "his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some\n",
       "minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\n",
       "family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\n",
       "neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they\n",
       "were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\n",
       "formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's\n",
       "offers of refreshment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\n",
       "in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its\n",
       "aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,\n",
       "as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But\n",
       "though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to\n",
       "gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at\n",
       "her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.\n",
       "When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be\n",
       "ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her\n",
       "eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but\n",
       "in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to\n",
       "admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to\n",
       "the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\n",
       "happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\n",
       "garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\n",
       "which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most\n",
       "respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\n",
       "with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\n",
       "owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\n",
       "through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\n",
       "interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\n",
       "with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\n",
       "fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\n",
       "the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\n",
       "the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the\n",
       "prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered\n",
       "the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome\n",
       "modern building, well situated on rising ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\n",
       "but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\n",
       "frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\n",
       "took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\n",
       "probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's\n",
       "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\n",
       "was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which\n",
       "Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\n",
       "forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by\n",
       "Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\n",
       "forgotten.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\n",
       "was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\n",
       "in, observed:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\n",
       "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\n",
       "be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\n",
       "doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice\n",
       "when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she\n",
       "will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\n",
       "honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\n",
       "charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed\n",
       "to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n",
       "_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\" added\n",
       "Charlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\n",
       "woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,\n",
       "and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,\n",
       "Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\n",
       "Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\n",
       "and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\n",
       "was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit\n",
       "would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious\n",
       "interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with\n",
       "Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.\n",
       "\n",
       "About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready\n",
       "for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in\n",
       "confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running\n",
       "upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened\n",
       "the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with\n",
       "agitation, cried out--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for\n",
       "there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make\n",
       "haste, and come down this moment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,\n",
       "and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in\n",

       "\n",

       "daughter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"La! my dear,\" said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \"it is not\n",
       "Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;\n",
       "the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\n",
       "creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\n",
       "Why does she not come in?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She\n",
       "looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\n",
       "make him a very proper wife.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\n",
       "with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was\n",

       "before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that\n",
       "way.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\n",
       "the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\n",
       "girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\n",

       "Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.\n",
       "The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering\n",
       "visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his\n",
       "wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity\n",

       "after your arrival!\"\n",

       "\"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which\n",
       "my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such\n",
       "instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their\n",
       "visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what\n",
       "they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and\n",
       "so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\n",
       "Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\n",
       "becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\n",
       "whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\n",
       "for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you\n",
       "for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank\n",
       "preserved.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different\n",
       "doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much\n",
       "objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of\n",
       "her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas\n",
       "who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her\n",
       "introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done\n",
       "to his presentation at St. James's.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a\n",
       "mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\n",
       "Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\n",
       "raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\n",
       "slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\n",
       "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\n",
       "cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every\n",
       "moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\n",
       "Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\n",
       "Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\n",
       "miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought\n",
       "she could witness without trepidation.\n",
       "\n",
       "From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\n",
       "rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they\n",
       "followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady\n",
       "Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,\n",
       "with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had\n",
       "settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should\n",
       "be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those\n",
       "apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely\n",
       "awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\n",
       "enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\n",
       "and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\n",
       "of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\n",
       "quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\n",
       "composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\n",
       "features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\n",
       "conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\n",
       "visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\n",
       "silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,\n",
       "as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\n",
       "Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she\n",
       "believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.\n",
       "\n",
       "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\n",
       "she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\n",
       "daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her\n",
       "being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\n",
       "likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her\n",
       "features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\n",
       "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\n",
       "there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\n",
       "to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\n",
       "her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\n",
       "admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\n",
       "and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\n",
       "looking at in the summer.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and\n",
       "all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had\n",
       "likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her\n",
       "ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\n",
       "nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted\n",
       "alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir\n",
       "William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law\n",
       "said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.\n",
       "But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and\n",
       "gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved\n",
       "a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth\n",
       "was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated\n",
       "between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\n",
       "listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\n",
       "dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little\n",
       "Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing\n",
       "she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the\n",
       "gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to\n",
       "be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\n",
       "intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\n",
       "subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to\n",
       "have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic\n",
       "concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as\n",
       "to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\n",
       "regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\n",
       "care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\n",
       "beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an\n",
       "occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse\n",
       "with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\n",
       "Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\n",
       "the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,\n",
       "pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters\n",
       "she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\n",
       "them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\n",
       "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been\n",
       "her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of\n",
       "her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\n",
       "observed,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your\n",
       "sake,\" turning to Charlotte, \"I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\n",
       "occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\n",
       "necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss\n",

       "\n",
       "\"A little.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"One of them does.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\n",

       "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\n",
       "and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\n",
       "wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\n",
       "way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\n",
       "of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\n",
       "it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,\n",
       "who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\n",
       "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's\n",
       "calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady\n",

       "must be very young?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be\n",

       "younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and\n",
       "amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\n",
       "marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\n",
       "at the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\n",
       "not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" said her ladyship, \"you give your opinion very decidedly\n",

       "down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\n",
       "two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\n",
       "party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\n",
       "uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\n",
       "expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or\n",
       "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\n",
       "other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\n",
       "of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\n",
       "was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her\n",
       "for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.\n",

       "round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\n",

       "the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\n",
       "Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon\n",

       "to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for\n",
       "Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her\n",
       "commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy\n",

       "enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,\n",
       "and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not\n",
       "often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his\n",
       "morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but\n",
       "when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,\n",

       "she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.\n",
       "\n",
       "From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and\n",
       "were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went\n",
       "along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,\n",
       "which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened\n",

       "to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\n",
       "hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,\n",
       "and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\n",
       "these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\n",
       "and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\n",
       "of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\n",

       "by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to\n",
       "be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\n",

       "them into harmony and plenty.\n",
       "\n",
       "The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\n",
       "and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\n",
       "card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\n",
       "of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living\n",
       "in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,\n",
       "however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\n",
       "comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with\n",
       "Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had\n",
       "often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she\n",
       "frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\n",
       "along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\n",
       "a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\n",

       "In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.\n",
       "Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an\n",
       "addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be\n",
       "important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was\n",
       "expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not\n",
       "many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would\n",
       "furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\n",
       "she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\n",
       "were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently\n",
       "destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\n",
       "satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\n",
       "seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\n",
       "Miss Lucas and herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\n",

       "in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his\n",
       "bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great\n",
       "intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his\n",
       "respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for\n",

       "who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\n",

       "used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual\n",
       "reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her\n",

       "in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part\n",
       "of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of\n",
       "credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all\n",
       "that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to\n",
       "say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such\n",
       "things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\n",

       "only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\n",

       "force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\n",
       "have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the\n",
       "trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\n",

       "and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised\n",
       "them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding\n",
       "on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying\n",
       "much to anybody, went away.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What can be the meaning of this?\" said Charlotte, as soon as he was\n",

       "conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from\n",
       "the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable\n",
       "from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there\n",
       "was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot\n",
       "always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the\n",
       "pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the\n",
       "two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither\n",
       "almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\n",
       "separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\n",
       "aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\n",
       "had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\n",
       "him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\n",
       "being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her\n",
       "former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw\n",
       "there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,\n",
       "she believed he might have the best informed mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult\n",
       "to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\n",
       "ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,\n",
       "it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice\n",
       "to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\n",
       "animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\n",
       "Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was\n",
       "generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\n",
       "her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect\n",
       "of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\n",
       "seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at\n",
       "Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\n",
       "certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\n",
       "look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\n",
       "doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\n",
       "seemed nothing but absence of mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\n",
       "being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\n",
       "Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\n",
       "raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\n",

       "In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\n",
       "Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he\n",
       "certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\n",
       "to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\n",

       "prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that\n",
       "it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\n",
       "therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like\n",
       "wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was\n",
       "not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "arranges the business just as he pleases.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\n",
       "pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\n",
       "more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n",
       "\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it\n",
       "than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\n",
       "feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\n",
       "dependence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\n",
       "either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\n",
       "dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\n",
       "wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\n",
       "experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\n",
       "weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where\n",
       "they like.\"\n",

       "\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\n",
       "do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many\n",
       "in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\n",
       "money.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\n",
       "idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what\n",
       "is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\n",
       "very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\n",
       "a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\n",
       "she soon afterwards said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\n",
       "having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\n",
       "lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\n",
       "for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\n",
       "likes with her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\n",
       "divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your\n",
       "charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a\n",
       "little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\n",
       "may like to have her own way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\n",
       "in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\n",
       "give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\n",
       "got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\n",
       "say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\n",
       "very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\n",
       "Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he\n",
       "is a great friend of Darcy's.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes,\" said Elizabeth drily; \"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\n",
       "Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\n",
       "those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in\n",
       "our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to\n",
       "him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that\n",
       "Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is it you mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,\n",
       "because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an\n",
       "unpleasant thing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\n",
       "Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\n",
       "on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\n",
       "imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\n",
       "particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing\n",
       "him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\n",
       "knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\n",
       "lady.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \"He\n",
       "only told me what I have now told you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\n",
       "indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\n",
       "was so thoughtful.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\n",
       "cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\n",
       "friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to\n",
       "determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.\n",
       "But,\" she continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\n",
       "particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\n",
       "that there was much affection in the case.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"but it is a\n",
       "lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture\n",
       "of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and\n",
       "therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent\n",
       "matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\n",
       "as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\n",
       "of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\n",
       "people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\n",
       "could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\n",
       "such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\n",
       "taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had\n",
       "always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement\n",
       "of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was\n",

       "immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides\n",
       "those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the\n",
       "subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of\n",
       "its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always\n",
       "opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to\n",
       "the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\n",
       "suit.\n",
       "\n",
       "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\n",
       "the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\n",
       "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\n",

       "his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt\n",
       "of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but\n",
       "his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could\n",
       "only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her\n",
       "cheeks, and she said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\n",
       "express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\n",
       "unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should\n",
       "be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\n",
       "cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\n",
       "bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\n",
       "anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\n",
       "of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented\n",

       "surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance\n",
       "of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\n",
       "appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\n",
       "himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\n",
       "dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!\n",
       "I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\n",
       "civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why with so evident a desire\n",
       "of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\n",
       "against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\n",
       "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\n",
       "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against\n",
       "you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you\n",
       "think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has\n",
       "been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most\n",
       "beloved sister?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\n",
       "was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\n",
       "continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\n",
       "excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\n",
       "you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means\n",
       "of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the\n",
       "world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for\n",
       "disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\n",
       "kind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\n",
       "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\n",
       "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\n",
       "\n",
       "With assumed tranquillity he then replied: \"I have no wish of denying\n",
       "that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\n",
       "sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\n",
       "kinder than towards myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\n",
       "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\n",
       "is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was\n",
       "decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\n",
       "many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\n",
       "say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\n",
       "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\" said Darcy,\n",
       "in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an\n",
       "interest in him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy contemptuously; \"yes, his misfortunes\n",
       "have been great indeed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth with energy. \"You have reduced\n",
       "him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have\n",
       "withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for\n",
       "him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence\n",
       "which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!\n",
       "and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and\n",
       "ridicule.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n",
       "\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!\n",
       "I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\n",
       "calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,\" added he, stopping in\n",
       "his walk, and turning towards her, \"these offenses might have been\n",
       "overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\n",
       "scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n",
       "bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\n",
       "policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of\n",
       "my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\n",
       "reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\n",
       "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and\n",
       "just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\n",
       "connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose\n",
       "condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\n",
       "the utmost to speak with composure when she said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\n",
       "declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared the concern\n",
       "which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more\n",
       "gentlemanlike manner.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that\n",
       "would have tempted me to accept it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\n",
       "expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of\n",
       "my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest\n",
       "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of\n",
       "the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of\n",
       "disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\n",
       "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\n",
       "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\n",
       "feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\n",
       "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\n",
       "wishes for your health and happiness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\n",
       "the next moment open the front door and quit the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how\n",
       "to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for\n",
       "half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,\n",
       "was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of\n",
       "marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for\n",
       "so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of\n",
       "all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying\n",
       "her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his\n",
       "own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired\n",
       "unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable\n",
       "pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to\n",
       "Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could\n",
       "not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.\n",
       "Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon\n",
       "overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for\n",
       "a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the\n",
       "sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to\n",
       "encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n",

       "Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\n",
       "which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\n",
       "surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything\n",
       "else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after\n",
       "breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\n",
       "directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\n",
       "sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\n",
       "she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The\n",
       "park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\n",
       "of the gates into the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\n",
       "tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\n",
       "look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\n",
       "made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\n",
       "verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,\n",
       "when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which\n",
       "edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.\n",
       "Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now\n",
       "near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced\n",
       "her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though\n",
       "in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the\n",
       "gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,\n",
       "which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,\n",
       "\"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.\n",
       "Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\" And then, with a\n",
       "slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\n",
       "Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,\n",
       "perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written\n",
       "quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\n",
       "full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\n",
       "from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension\n",
       "of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those\n",
       "offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\n",
       "intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes\n",
       "which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\n",
       "effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\n",
       "should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\n",
       "and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\n",
       "your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\n",
       "demand it of your justice.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n",
       "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\n",
       "that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\n",
       "from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\n",
       "claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\n",
       "prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\n",
       "wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\n",
       "favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\n",
       "dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\n",
       "its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\n",
       "persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\n",
       "bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\n",
       "night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\n",
       "to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions\n",
       "and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which\n",
       "is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which\n",
       "may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity\n",
       "must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with\n",
       "others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young\n",
       "woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance\n",
       "at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious\n",
       "attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I\n",
       "had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir\n",
       "William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to\n",
       "your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.\n",
       "He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could\n",
       "be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour\n",
       "attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss\n",
       "Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also\n",
       "watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,\n",
       "but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced\n",
       "from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions\n",
       "with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of\n",
       "sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been\n",
       "in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter\n",
       "probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict\n",
       "pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not\n",
       "scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and\n",

       "was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led\n",
       "me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy\n",

       "detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in\n",

       "might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose\n",
       "that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been\n",
       "seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your\n",
       "sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his\n",
       "affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great\n",
       "natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his\n",
       "own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was\n",
       "no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into\n",
       "Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the\n",
       "work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There\n",
       "is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not\n",
       "reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the\n",

       "ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me\n",
       "enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this\n",
       "concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it\n",
       "was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no\n",

       "be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his\n",
       "kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at\n",

       "own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have\n",
       "been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only\n",

       "that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a\n",
       "valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There\n",
       "was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long\n",
       "survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham\n",

       "he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more\n",
       "immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he\n",
       "could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying\n",

       "be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed\n",
       "him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to\n",
       "his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the\n",

       "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\n",
       "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\n",
       "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\n",
       "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly\n",
       "lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free\n",
       "from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.\n",
       "For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the\n",
       "incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to\n",
       "me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured\n",
       "me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He\n",
       "had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely\n",
       "resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in\n",
       "question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was\n",
       "well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not\n",
       "have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame\n",
       "me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every\n",
       "repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of\n",
       "his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me\n",
       "to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every\n",
       "appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But\n",

       "About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed\n",

       "a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and\n",
       "how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented\n",
       "any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place\n",
       "immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.\n",
       "Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which\n",

       "you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never\n",

       "There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.\n",
       "Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The\n",
       "comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond\n",

       "father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\n",

       "\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me\n",
       "to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\n",
       "relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\n",
       "myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\n",
       "conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy\n",

       "to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to\n",
       "anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,\n",

       "re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had\n",

       "to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,\n",
       "of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other\n",
       "half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she\n",
       "had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one\n",
       "could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect\n",
       "understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off\n",
       "this last encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if that very\n",

       "in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,\n",
       "and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first\n",
       "attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,\n",

       "a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least\n",
       "chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of\n",
       "his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\"\n",

       "exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she\n",
       "considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense\n",
       "for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it\n",
       "known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her\n",
       "go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general\n",
       "behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of\n",
       "such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more\n",
       "imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must\n",
       "be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Already arisen?\" repeated Mr. Bennet. \"What, has she frightened away\n",
       "some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such\n",
       "squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity\n",
       "are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who\n",
       "have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not\n",
       "of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our\n",
       "importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the\n",
       "wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark\n",
       "Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear\n",
       "father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and\n",
       "of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of\n",
       "her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character\n",
       "will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt\n",
       "that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the\n",
       "worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond\n",
       "youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness\n",
       "of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal\n",
       "contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger\n",
       "Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,\n",
       "ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you\n",
       "suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever\n",
       "they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the\n",
       "disgrace?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and\n",
       "affectionately taking her hand said in reply:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known\n",
       "you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less\n",
       "advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly\n",
       "sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to\n",
       "Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will\n",
       "keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an\n",
       "object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance\n",
       "even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find\n",
       "women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being\n",
       "there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow\n",
       "many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest\n",
       "of her life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion\n",
       "continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not\n",
       "in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on\n",
       "them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret\n",
       "over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her\n",
       "disposition.\n",
       "\n",
       "Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her\n",
       "father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their\n",
       "united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised\n",
       "every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye\n",
       "of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.\n",
       "She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them\n",
       "at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents\n",
       "stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young\n",
       "and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she\n",
       "saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six\n",
       "officers at once.\n",
       "\n",
       "Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such\n",
       "realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have\n",
       "been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.\n",
       "Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy\n",
       "conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures\n",

       "home.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\n",
       "frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\n",
       "well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had even\n",
       "learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted\n",
       "her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\n",
       "behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,\n",
       "for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which\n",
       "had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\n",
       "what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\n",
       "finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\n",
       "gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\n",
       "reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\n",
       "cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\n",
       "and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,\n",

       "disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some\n",
       "inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\n",
       "mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\n",
       "weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.\n",
       "\n",
       "He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's\n",
       "recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\n",
       "him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\n",
       "asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\n",
       "With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:\n",

       "\"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed!\" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. \"And\n",
       "pray, may I ask?--\" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \"Is\n",
       "it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much\n",
       "what he ever was.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\n",
       "rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a\n",
       "something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\n",
       "and anxious attention, while she added:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\n",
       "his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from\n",
       "knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\n",
       "look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his\n",
       "embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\n",
       "accents:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\n",
       "comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\n",
       "even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\n",
       "may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only\n",
       "deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only\n",
       "fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been\n",
       "alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good\n",
       "opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always\n",
       "operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be\n",
       "imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I\n",

       "\n",
       "Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\n",
       "slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\n",
       "the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\n",
       "him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his\n",
       "side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\n",

       "only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.\n",

       "woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in\n",
       "their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,\n",
       "esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views\n",

       "respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\n",
       "herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\n",
       "banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\n",
       "and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\n",

       "other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties\n",
       "abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and\n",
       "sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around\n",

       "name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have\n",
       "some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\n",
       "again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\n",
       "present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\n",
       "was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation\n",
       "for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\n",

       "far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\n",
       "the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\n",
       "the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the\n",
       "present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that\n",
       "county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\n",
       "weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\n",
       "town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\n",

       "must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so\n",
       "many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. \"If it were merely a fine house\n",
       "richly furnished,\" said she, \"I should not care about it myself; but\n",
       "the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\n",
       "country.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The\n",
       "possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\n",
       "occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and\n",
       "thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such\n",
       "a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\n",
       "that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the\n",
       "absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\n",
       "whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its\n",
       "proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\n",
       "the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her\n",
       "alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\n",
       "curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\n",
       "next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\n",
       "with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\n",
       "to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\n",
       "Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\n",
       "in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\n",
       "entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\n",
       "a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\n",
       "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\n",
       "half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\n",
       "eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\n",
       "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which\n",
       "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\n",
       "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of\n",
       "high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was\n",
       "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\n",
       "were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\n",
       "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\n",
       "beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
       "all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\n",
       "to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n",
       "\n",
       "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\n",
       "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\n",
       "meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\n",
       "mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\n",
       "hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\n",
       "wonder at her being where she was.\n",
       "\n",
       "The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less\n",
       "fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\n",
       "followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned\n",
       "room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\n",
       "to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which\n",
       "they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,\n",
       "was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and\n",
       "she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its\n",
       "banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,\n",
       "with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking\n",
       "different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be\n",
       "seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to\n",
       "the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of\n",
       "his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of\n",
       "splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With\n",
       "these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\n",
       "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\n",
       "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,\"--recollecting\n",
       "herself--\"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\n",
       "me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like\n",
       "regret.\n",
       "\n",
       "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really\n",
       "absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question\n",
       "was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.\n",
       "Reynolds replied that he was, adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with\n",
       "a large party of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own\n",
       "journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\n",
       "\n",
       "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the\n",
       "likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,\n",
       "over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.\n",
       "The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young\n",
       "gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought\n",
       "up by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into the army,\" she added;\n",
       "\"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\n",
       "return it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n",
       "\"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\n",
       "other--about eight years ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have heard much of your master's fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
       "looking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\n",
       "us whether it is like or not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\n",
       "intimation of her knowing her master.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth coloured, and said: \"A little.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, very handsome.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\n",
       "will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\n",
       "master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\n",
       "be then. He was very fond of them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\n",
       "when she was only eight years old.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\n",
       "accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is\n",
       "a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she\n",
       "comes here to-morrow with him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her\n",
       "communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either\n",
       "by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\n",
       "master and his sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his\n",
       "time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\n",
       "good enough for him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is\n",
       "very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,\"\n",
       "replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she\n",
       "listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, \"I have\n",
       "never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever\n",
       "since he was four years old.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\n",
       "ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\n",
       "Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was\n",
       "grateful to her uncle for saying:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\n",
       "having such a master.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could\n",
       "not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\n",
       "good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and\n",
       "he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\n",
       "world.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\" thought she.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\n",
       "as affable to the poor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\n",
       "Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\n",
       "of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\n",
       "furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\n",
       "prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\n",
       "master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\n",
       "many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\n",
       "lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but\n",
       "themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give\n",
       "him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw\n",
       "anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away\n",
       "like other young men.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked, \"is not\n",
       "quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty\n",
       "sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\n",
       "the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\n",
       "give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when\n",
       "last at Pemberley.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\n",
       "one of the windows.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\n",
       "the room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever\n",
       "can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There\n",
       "is nothing he would not do for her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were\n",
       "all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;\n",
       "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\n",
       "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\n",
       "Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\n",
       "also more intelligible.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\n",
       "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of\n",
       "the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested\n",
       "her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a\n",
       "smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he\n",
       "looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest\n",
       "contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.\n",
       "Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's\n",
       "lifetime.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\n",
       "sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of\n",
       "their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\n",
       "was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\n",
       "of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\n",
       "considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how\n",
       "much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of\n",
       "good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought\n",
       "forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she\n",
       "stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his\n",
       "eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of\n",
       "gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and\n",
       "softened its impropriety of expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\n",
       "they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\n",
       "consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\n",
       "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former\n",
       "was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\n",
       "suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his\n",
       "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\n",
       "instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest\n",
       "blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\n",
       "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\n",
       "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\n",
       "of perfect civility.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\n",
       "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\n",
       "overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\n",
       "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\n",
       "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\n",
       "beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\n",
       "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\n",
       "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer\n",
       "she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\n",
       "alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that\n",
       "he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\n",
       "impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\n",
       "minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in\n",
       "her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent\n",
       "had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as\n",
       "to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in\n",
       "Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\n",
       "distraction of his thoughts.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few\n",
       "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\n",
       "leave.\n",
       "\n",
       "The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but\n",
       "Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,\n",
       "followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her\n",
       "coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the\n",
       "world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light\n",
       "might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely\n",
       "thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he\n",
       "thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes\n",
       "sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;\n",
       "for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted\n",
       "from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over\n",
       "the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly\n",
       "altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was\n",
       "amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!\n",
       "Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never\n",
       "had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What\n",
       "a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put\n",
       "his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account\n",
       "for it.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\n",
       "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\n",
       "reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time\n",
       "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\n",
       "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and\n",
       "seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",
       "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n",
       "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n",
       "was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in\n",
       "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\n",
       "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n",
       "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was\n",
       "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in\n",
       "seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\n",
       "composure.\n",
       "\n",
       "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\n",
       "aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
       "ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of\n",
       "the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the\n",
       "valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading\n",
       "many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish\n",
       "of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.\n",
       "With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.\n",
       "It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which\n",
       "brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,\n",
       "to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed\n",
       "it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;\n",
       "it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the\n",
       "valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,\n",
       "and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.\n",
       "Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the\n",
       "bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
       "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only\n",
       "of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\n",
       "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
       "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
       "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
       "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
       "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the\n",
       "man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\n",
       "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment\n",
       "was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n",
       "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here\n",
       "less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before\n",
       "they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared\n",
       "for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
       "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n",
       "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\n",
       "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
       "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw\n",
       "that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his\n",
       "politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;\n",
       "but she had not got beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when\n",
       "some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of\n",
       "Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,\n",
       "and she said no more.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\n",
       "her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n",
       "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;\n",
       "and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\n",
       "acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had\n",
       "revolted in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought\n",
       "she, \"when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of\n",
       "fashion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n",
       "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\n",
       "it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n",
       "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\n",
       "connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and\n",
       "so far from going away, turned his back with them, and entered into\n",
       "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
       "could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had\n",
       "some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
       "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
       "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\n",
       "his taste, or his good manners.\n",
       "\n",
       "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\n",
       "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\n",
       "chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time\n",
       "to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",
       "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\n",
       "walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.\n",
       "Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment\n",
       "must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and\n",
       "continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From what can\n",
       "it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his\n",
       "manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a\n",
       "change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\n",
       "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to\n",
       "the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\n",
       "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated\n",
       "in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\n",
       "Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\n",
       "her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\n",
       "together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him\n",
       "to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\n",
       "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\n",
       "very unexpected--\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that\n",
       "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we\n",
       "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected\n",
       "in the country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that\n",
       "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\n",
       "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They\n",
       "will join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some\n",
       "who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\n",
       "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last\n",
       "mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_\n",
       "mind was not very differently engaged.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a\n",
       "pause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\n",
       "me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\n",
       "during your stay at Lambton?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\n",
       "for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\n",
       "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her\n",
       "must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was\n",
       "satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\n",
       "him think really ill of her.\n",
       "\n",
       "They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\n",
       "was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\n",
       "pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\n",
       "the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had\n",
       "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\n",
       "mile behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\n",
       "tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\n",
       "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\n",
       "there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected\n",
       "that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale\n",
       "with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her\n",
       "patience and her ideas were nearly worn our before the tete-a-tete was\n",
       "over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go\n",
       "into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and\n",
       "they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\n",
       "ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\n",
       "walking slowly towards the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\n",
       "pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n",
       "\"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,\" said her uncle.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,\" replied her\n",
       "aunt, \"but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\n",
       "say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I\n",
       "have seen nothing of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\n",
       "than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\n",
       "attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham;\n",
       "or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features\n",
       "are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so\n",
       "disagreeable?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked\n",
       "him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never\n",
       "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied\n",
       "her uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\n",
       "at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off\n",
       "his grounds.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but\n",
       "said nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really\n",
       "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\n",
       "anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\n",
       "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\n",
       "speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would\n",
       "not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\n",
       "good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!\n",
       "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\n",
       "master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every\n",
       "virtue.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\n",
       "his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in\n",
       "as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from\n",
       "his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\n",
       "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\n",
       "Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\n",
       "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\n",
       "transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\n",
       "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now\n",
       "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\n",
       "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\n",
       "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of\n",
       "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they\n",
       "had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n",
       "acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a\n",
       "intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\n",
       "\n",
       "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\n",
       "much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\n",
       "but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above\n",
       "all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n",

       "her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently\n",
       "resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.\n",
       "But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their\n",
       "arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the\n",
       "place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn\n",
       "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\n",
       "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in\n",
       "a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing\n",
       "the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her\n",
       "surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she\n",
       "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\n",
       "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\n",
       "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\n",
       "the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that\n",
       "there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a\n",
       "quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\n",
       "newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\n",
       "Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite\n",
       "amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,\n",
       "she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much\n",
       "in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\n",
       "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\n",
       "\n",
       "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\n",
       "up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\n",
       "inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\n",
       "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\n",
       "acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\n",
       "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\n",
       "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\n",
       "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\n",
       "her beyond a monosyllable.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\n",
       "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\n",
       "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there\n",
       "was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\n",
       "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\n",
       "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\n",
       "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley\n",
       "was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\n",
       "satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick\n",
       "step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\n",
       "Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\n",
       "felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\n",
       "cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\n",
       "inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked\n",
       "and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\n",
       "\n",
       "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\n",
       "than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\n",
       "them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\n",
       "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards\n",
       "each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from\n",
       "those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew\n",
       "what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little\n",
       "in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\n",
       "evident enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\n",
       "feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and\n",
       "to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\n",
       "feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\n",
       "endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\n",

       "\n",
       "In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!\n",
       "how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in\n",
       "a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on\n",
       "former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion\n",
       "that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,\n",
       "though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his\n",
       "behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look\n",
       "appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred\n",
       "between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point\n",
       "she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred\n",
       "ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a\n",
       "recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying\n",
       "more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed\n",
       "to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone\n",
       "which had something of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since\n",
       "he had had the pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply,\n",
       "he added, \"It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of\n",
       "November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\n",
       "took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether\n",
       "_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,\n",
       "nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which\n",
       "gave them meaning.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;\n",
       "but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\n",
       "complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed\n",
       "from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\n",
       "the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however\n",
       "temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\n",
       "she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion\n",
       "of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\n",
       "disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\n",
       "very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\n",
       "lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was\n",
       "so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\n",
       "restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\n",
       "of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\n",
       "at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\n",
       "self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance\n",
       "could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\n",
       "acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw\n",

       "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\n",

       "readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\n",
       "how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\n",
       "acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,\n",
       "that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\n",
       "any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\n",
       "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\n",
       "her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\n",

       "again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\n",
       "make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\n",
       "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on\n",
       "this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\n",
       "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some\n",
       "satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been\n",
       "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\n",
       "uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\n",
       "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\n",
       "\n",
       "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was\n",
       "not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\n",
       "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\n",
       "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\n",
       "interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\n",
       "\n",
       "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\n",
       "as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\n",
       "not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\n",
       "from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference\n",
       "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\n",

       "that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\n",
       "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\n",
       "hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\n",
       "their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\n",
       "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\n",
       "it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town\n",
       "where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\n",

       "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;\n",
       "and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She\n",
       "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\n",
       "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\n",
       "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\n",
       "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\n",
       "time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened\n",
       "into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in\n",
       "his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\n",
       "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\n",
       "there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.\n",
       "It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,\n",
       "but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and\n",
       "acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations\n",
       "accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid\n",
       "her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most\n",
       "eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display\n",
       "of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only\n",
       "were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent\n",
       "on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much\n",
       "pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent\n",
       "love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a\n",
       "sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be\n",
       "exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,\n",

       "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more\n",
       "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\n",
       "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\n",
       "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\n",

       "complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\n",
       "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\n",
       "pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would\n",

       "meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\n",
       "was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\n",
       "her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very\n",
       "wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\n",
       "hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\n",
       "meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\n",

       "to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\n",
       "recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\n",

       "\n",
       "\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could\n",

       "brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose\n",
       "wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\n",
       "tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,\n",
       "which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything\n",
       "extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do\n",
       "not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency\n",

       "wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\n",
       "success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a\n",
       "determination of making him speak, she continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\n",
       "were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\n",

       "be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my\n",
       "uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will\n",
       "immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\n",
       "as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing\n",
       "a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was\n",
       "opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\n",
       "manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,\n",
       "she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,\n",
       "hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find\n",
       "Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not\n",
       "an instant to lose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\n",
       "politeness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute;\n",
       "but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\n",
       "not well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how\n",
       "little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\n",
       "the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless\n",
       "an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\n",
       "mistress home instantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and\n",
       "looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\n",
       "or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n",
       "\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\n",
       "present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\n",
       "is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by\n",
       "some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\n",
       "not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\n",
       "something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\n",
       "silence. At length she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from Jane,\n",
       "with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger\n",
       "sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into\n",
       "the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.\n",
       "_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no\n",
       "connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added in a yet\n",
       "more agitated voice, \"that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what\n",
       "he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I\n",
       "learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\n",
       "have happened. But it is all--all too late now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am grieved indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked. But is it\n",
       "certain--absolutely certain?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\n",
       "almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\n",
       "Scotland.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\n",
       "immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But\n",
       "nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\n",
       "such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\n",
       "not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what\n",
       "I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\n",
       "much. Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking\n",
       "up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air\n",
       "gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her\n",
       "power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\n",
       "weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\n",
       "wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\n",
       "consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\n",
       "was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\n",
       "wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\n",
       "him, as now, when all love must be vain.\n",
       "\n",
       "But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\n",
       "humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed\n",
       "up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\n",
       "Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\n",
       "several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by\n",
       "the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\n",
       "compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\n",
       "long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my\n",
       "stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything\n",
       "could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to\n",
       "such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may\n",
       "seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I\n",
       "fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley\n",
       "to-day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\n",
       "urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\n",
       "long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for\n",
       "her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\n",
       "reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\n",
       "one serious, parting look, went away.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\n",
       "should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as\n",
       "had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\n",
       "retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full\n",
       "of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\n",
       "feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\n",
       "formerly have rejoiced in its termination.\n",
       "\n",
       "If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\n",
       "change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\n",
       "otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\n",
       "unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on\n",
       "a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been\n",
       "exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\n",
       "somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,\n",
       "and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other\n",
       "less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him\n",
       "go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\n",
       "produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\n",
       "business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\n",
       "a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\n",
       "could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\n",
       "of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\n",
       "letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\n",
       "Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\n",
       "for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\n",
       "incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\n",
       "as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose\n",
       "Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention\n",
       "of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue\n",
       "nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\n",
       "Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia\n",
       "wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\n",
       "officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\n",
       "raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been\n",
       "fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\n",
       "mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\n",
       "feel it!\n",
       "\n",
       "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\n",
       "share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\n",
       "family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\n",
       "requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\n",
       "could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\n",
       "importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.\n",
       "and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's\n",
       "account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them\n",
       "instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their\n",
       "summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript\n",
       "of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a\n",
       "favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply\n",
       "afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the\n",
       "first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every\n",
       "assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked\n",
       "him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,\n",
       "everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to\n",
       "be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be done about Pemberley?\"\n",
       "cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for\n",
       "us; was it so?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n",
       "_That_ is all settled.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\n",
       "prepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\n",
       "truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the\n",
       "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\n",
       "to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\n",
       "impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\n",
       "business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\n",
       "be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\n",
       "sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\n",
       "Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\n",
       "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\n",
       "the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\n",
       "have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\" said her uncle, as they\n",
       "drove from the town; \"and really, upon serious consideration, I am much\n",
       "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the\n",
       "matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should\n",
       "form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\n",
       "friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\n",
       "am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\n",
       "would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\n",
       "regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\n",
       "not adequate to the risk!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle's\n",
       "opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\n",
       "interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of\n",
       "Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\n",
       "him capable of it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other\n",
       "neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I\n",
       "dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been\n",
       "the case?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\n",
       "that they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such\n",
       "a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\n",
       "Barnet road.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\n",
       "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is\n",
       "not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\n",
       "might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\n",
       "expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\n",
       "marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\n",
       "friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\n",
       "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\n",
       "cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she\n",
       "beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,\n",
       "forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\n",
       "restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\n",
       "dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\n",
       "nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\n",
       "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has\n",
       "no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\n",
       "behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\n",
       "seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\n",
       "do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\n",
       "such a matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him\n",
       "as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, with\n",
       "tears in her eyes, \"that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such\n",
       "a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\n",
       "Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never\n",
       "been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,\n",
       "nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement\n",
       "and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\n",
       "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\n",
       "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\n",
       "flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing\n",
       "everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\n",
       "greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are\n",
       "naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of\n",
       "person and address that can captivate a woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you see that Jane,\" said her aunt, \"does not think so very ill of\n",
       "Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\n",
       "their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,\n",
       "till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\n",
       "Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\n",
       "sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\n",
       "as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do you really know all this?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\n",
       "as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, colouring. \"I told you, the other day,\n",
       "of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at\n",
       "Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved\n",
       "with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\n",
       "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\n",
       "relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\n",
       "what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\n",
       "reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\n",
       "must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\n",
       "her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\n",
       "and Jane seem so well to understand?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\n",
       "so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\n",
       "ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire\n",
       "was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the\n",
       "case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\n",
       "necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could\n",
       "it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the\n",
       "neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was\n",
       "settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening\n",
       "her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be\n",
       "in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\n",
       "consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far\n",
       "enough from my thoughts.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\n",
       "suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\n",
       "side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\n",
       "that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\n",
       "he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\n",
       "were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\n",
       "the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\n",
       "attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\n",
       "wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\n",
       "who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\n",
       "to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by\n",
       "its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\n",
       "the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.\n",
       "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find\n",
       "no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night\n",
       "on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a\n",

       "faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\n",
       "capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\n",

       "in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\n",
       "which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of\n",
       "fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was\n",
       "mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance\n",

       "\n",
       "Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n",

       "Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious\n",
       "part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters\n",
       "was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,\n",
       "whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every\n",
       "succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.\n",

       "had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,\n",
       "she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his\n",
       "letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as\n",

       "\"MY DEAR SIR,\n",

       "\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\n",
       "in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\n",
       "suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from\n",
       "Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself\n",
       "sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in\n",
       "your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because\n",
       "proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be\n",
       "wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that\n",
       "may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the\n",
       "most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would\n",
       "have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to\n",
       "be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte\n",
       "informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has\n",
       "proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,\n",
       "for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think\n",
       "that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be\n",
       "guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,\n",
       "you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined\n",
       "by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to\n",
       "whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that\n",
       "this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of\n",
       "all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,\n",
       "will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads\n",
       "me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event\n",
       "of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved\n",
       "in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to\n",
       "console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child\n",
       "from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her\n",
       "own heinous offense.\n",

       "Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.\n",
       "It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he\n",
       "kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one\n",
       "living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he\n",
       "had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of\n",
       "particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,\n",
       "who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the\n",
       "wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for\n",
       "secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for\n",
       "it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a\n",
       "very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a\n",
       "thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.\n",
       "He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more\n",
       "formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars\n",
       "from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \"A gamester!\"\n",
       "she cried. \"This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their\n",
       "father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered\n",
       "spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded\n",
       "to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and\n",
       "leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable\n",
       "for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did\n",

       "what her anxiety for his life had been before.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\" she cried. \"Sure he\n",

       "the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their\n",

       "tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware\n",
       "that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of\n",

       "distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said her father; \"Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing\n",

       "and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I comfort myself with thinking,\" replied Jane, \"that he certainly would\n",
       "not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind\n",
       "uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten\n",
       "thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children\n",
       "of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand\n",

       "not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never\n",
       "be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal\n",
       "protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as\n",
       "years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is\n",
       "actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,\n",

       "thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself\n",
       "they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in\n",
       "time make their past imprudence forgotten.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\n",
       "perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\n",

       "would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,\n",
       "the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As\n",
       "soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon\n",
       "married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its\n",
       "exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she\n",
       "had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter\n",
       "would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her\n",
       "felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\n",

       "that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\n",

       "resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her\n",
       "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe\n",
       "possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new\n",

       "blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\n",

       "and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\n",
       "the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\n",
       "anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say\n",
       "to her eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\n",

       "\n",
       "It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment\n",
       "from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\n",
       "spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and\n",
       "all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham\"\n",
       "by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her\n",
       "ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.\n",

       "am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half\n",
       "my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get\n",
       "husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\n",
       "things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We\n",
       "shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\n",
       "balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\n",

       "\n",
       "No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and\n",
       "she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and\n",
       "having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\n",

       "\n",
       "Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected\n",
       "to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her\n",
       "present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\n",
       "their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\n",
       "than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\n",
       "for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\n",
       "that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\n",
       "if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\n",
       "of having a companion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\n",
       "occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You\n",

       "\n",
       "\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\n",
       "married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\n",
       "that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\n",
       "o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\n",
       "were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\n",
       "such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to\n",
       "put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was\n",
       "my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as\n",
       "if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in\n",
       "ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed\n",
       "to know whether he would be married in his blue coat.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\n",
       "be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\n",
       "were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\n",
       "me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\n",
       "fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was\n",
       "rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so\n",
       "just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon\n",
       "business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once\n",
       "they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I\n",
       "did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we\n",
       "were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he\n",
       "came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,\n",
       "I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the\n",
       "wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious\n",
       "me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\n",
       "them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If it was to be secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the\n",
       "subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will\n",
       "ask you no questions.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you,\" said Lydia, \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you\n",
       "all, and then Wickham would be angry.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\n",
       "power, by running away.\n",
       "\n",
       "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least\n",
       "it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at\n",
       "her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\n",
       "where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\n",
       "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\n",
       "brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\n",
       "placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\n",
       "could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\n",
       "wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\n",
       "Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\n",
       "intended.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity must be\n",
       "to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively\n",
       "speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\n",
       "a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\n",
       "for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems\n",
       "to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\n",
       "ignorance.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to\n",
       "be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to\n",

       "to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise\n",
       "what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your\n",

       "however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such\n",

       "\n",
       "\"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most\n",
       "unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several\n",
       "hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so\n",
       "dreadfully racked as _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.\n",
       "Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,\n",
       "and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,\n",
       "Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\n",
       "after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n",
       "them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n",
       "himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to\n",
       "make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide\n",
       "in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and\n",
       "confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private\n",
       "actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He\n",
       "called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy\n",
       "an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_\n",
       "motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days\n",
       "in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to\n",
       "direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness\n",
       "of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago\n",
       "governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause\n",
       "of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large\n",
       "house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting\n",
       "lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with\n",
       "Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to\n",
       "town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n",
       "wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and\n",
       "corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.\n",
       "Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had\n",
       "she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up\n",
       "their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the\n",
       "wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and\n",
       "afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he\n",
       "acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful\n",
       "situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed\n",
       "on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But\n",
       "he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared\n",
       "for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear\n",
       "of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n",
       "other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,\n",
       "it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,\n",
       "in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never\n",
       "been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,\n",
       "on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and\n",
       "scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her\n",
       "own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as\n",
       "to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He\n",
       "must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\n",
       "nothing to live on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though\n",
       "Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able\n",
       "to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by\n",
       "marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still\n",
       "cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in\n",
       "some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely\n",
       "to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of\n",
       "course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be\n",
       "reasonable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to\n",
       "make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n",
       "street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be\n",
       "seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was\n",
       "still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge\n",
       "your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your\n",
       "uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the\n",
       "departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next\n",
       "day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,\n",
       "and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all\n",
       "settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to\n",
       "Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that\n",
       "obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been\n",
       "accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.\n",
       "Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and\n",
       "I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your\n",
       "uncle would most readily have settled the whole.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either\n",
       "the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle\n",
       "was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his\n",
       "niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\n",
       "which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter\n",
       "this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation\n",
       "that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n",
       "it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane\n",
       "at most.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young\n",
       "people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably\n",
       "more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own\n",
       "settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all\n",
       "this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It\n",
       "was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that\n",
       "Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he\n",
       "had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth\n",
       "in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,\n",
       "can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,\n",
       "my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would\n",
       "never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another\n",
       "interest_ in the affair.\n",

       "afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant\n",
       "admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I\n",

       "home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell\n",

       "serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had\n",
       "done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she\n",
       "heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\n",

       "avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had\n",
       "done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her\n",
       "heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly\n",
       "checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity\n",
       "was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for\n",
       "a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so\n",
       "natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law\n",
       "of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,\n",
       "to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had\n",
       "given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary\n",
       "stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been\n",
       "wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and\n",
       "though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she\n",
       "could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist\n",
       "his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially\n",
       "concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were\n",
       "under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They\n",
       "owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!\n",
       "how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever\n",
       "encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For\n",
       "herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause\n",
       "of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.\n",
       "She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It\n",
       "was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some\n",
       "pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she\n",
       "and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted\n",
       "between Mr. Darcy and herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's\n",

       "overtaken by Wickham.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?\" said he,\n",
       "as he joined her.\n",
       "\n",

       "that the interruption must be unwelcome.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and\n",

       "\n",
       "\"True. Are the others coming out?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\n",
       "Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that\n",
       "you have actually seen Pemberley.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She replied in the affirmative.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\n",
       "for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\n",
       "old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\n",
       "me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, she did.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what did she say?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\n",
       "out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\n",
       "misrepresented.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\n",
       "silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\n",

       "\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\n",

       "time of year.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\n",

       "\"Very much.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\n",
       "or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\n",
       "you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\n",

       "\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\n",
       "most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited\n",
       "me in every respect.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,\n",
       "and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\n",
       "repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\n",
       "quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas\n",
       "of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\n",
       "circumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\n",
       "first, you may remember.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not\n",
       "so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\n",
       "declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\n",
       "had been compromised accordingly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\n",

       "to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,\n",

       "\"He is as fine a fellow,\" said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of\n",
       "the house, \"as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to\n",

       "at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\n",
       "master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\n",
       "weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs.\n",

       "that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am\n",
       "sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome\n",
       "to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?\n",
       "But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to\n",
       "mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nicholls was in\n",
       "Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\n",
       "to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He\n",

       "\n",
       "Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing\n",
       "colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\n",
       "Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\n",
       "report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from\n",
       "any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\n",
       "I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\n",
       "me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes\n",
       "alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of\n",
       "_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no\n",
       "other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\n",
       "to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\n",
       "there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\n",
       "without it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot\n",

       "\n",
       "In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\n",

       "more unequal, than she had often seen them.\n",
       "\n",
       "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\n",
       "about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n",

       "will wait on him of course.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\n",
       "went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\n",
       "nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\n",
       "would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\n",
       "Netherfield.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society,\n",
       "let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait\n",
       "on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I\n",
       "am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\n",

       "him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\n",
       "husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\n",
       "neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\n",
       "_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It\n",
       "would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\n",
       "hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\n",
       "but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\n",
       "says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish I could say anything to comfort you,\" replied Elizabeth; \"but it\n",
       "is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\n",
       "of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\n",
       "always so much.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\n",
       "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\n",
       "and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted\n",
       "the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;\n",
       "hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his\n",
       "arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,\n",
       "enter the paddock and ride towards the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\n",
       "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\n",
       "to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\n",
       "again by her sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\n",

       "know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with\n",
       "him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\n",
       "Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\n",
       "say that I hate the very sight of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\n",
       "of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\n",
       "which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\n",
       "after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\n",
       "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\n",
       "mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\n",
       "civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either\n",
       "of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\n",
       "suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\n",
       "Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\n",
       "To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\n",
       "and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\n",
       "information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\n",
       "for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\n",
       "interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as\n",
       "what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\n",
       "coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\n",
       "was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\n",
       "behaviour in Derbyshire.\n",
       "\n",
       "The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\n",
       "minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\n",
       "her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and\n",
       "wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\n",
       "enough for expectation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\n",
       "lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of\n",
       "her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\n",
       "paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\n",
       "gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\n",
       "tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\n",
       "symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\n",
       "again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\n",
       "had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,\n",
       "she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\n",
       "she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\n",
       "presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\n",
       "not an improbable, conjecture.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\n",
       "saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,\n",
       "especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\n",
       "her curtsey and address to his friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter\n",
       "the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,\n",
       "was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\n",
       "applied.\n",
       "\n",
       "Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\n",
       "which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He\n",
       "was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but\n",
       "it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,\n",
       "when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without\n",
       "bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist\n",
       "the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\n",
       "found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\n",
       "the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\n",
       "they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry\n",
       "with herself for being so.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;\n",

       "make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\n",
       "dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\n",

       "hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\n",
       "Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay\n",
       "I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have\n",
       "heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\n",

       "\n",

       "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt\n",

       "\n",
       "\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to\n",

       "former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;\n",
       "but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He\n",
       "found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and\n",
       "as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\n",
       "difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\n",
       "that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,\n",
       "that she did not always know when she was silent.\n",

       "the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\n",
       "her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore\n",
       "to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\n",
       "hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\n",
       "decided. He placed himself by her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.\n",
       "He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\n",
       "Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\n",
       "likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\n",
       "alarm.\n",
       "\n",
       "His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an\n",
       "admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\n",
       "Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\n",
       "own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\n",
       "consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\n",
       "gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\n",
       "no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\n",
       "could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\n",
       "such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\n",
       "advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\n",
       "she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\n",
       "cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,\n",
       "made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\n",
       "and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\n",
       "him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the\n",

       "the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious\n",
       "and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\n",
       "gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her\n",
       "uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all\n",

       "\n",

       "where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\n",
       "in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her\n",
       "which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\n",
       "the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:\n",

       "\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\n",

       "\n",
       "\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\n",
       "expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\n",

       "There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\n",

       "mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\n",
       "with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\n",
       "They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\n",
       "nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\n",
       "of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\n",
       "supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What\n",
       "say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\n",
       "I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\n",
       "venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so\n",
       "fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\n",

       "were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\n",
       "cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\n",

       "what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\n",
       "at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\n",
       "a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\n",
       "and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\n",

       "not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The\n",

       "and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\n",
       "every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\n",
       "to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\n",
       "for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\n",

       "saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\n",
       "had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\n",
       "sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\n",
       "earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\n",
       "both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would\n",
       "have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she\n",
       "thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\n",
       "Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\n",
       "well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\n",
       "words to her sister, ran out of the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\n",
       "pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\n",
       "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\n",
       "why is not everybody as happy?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,\n",
       "a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\n",
       "kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\n",
       "allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\n",
       "said for the present.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\n",
       "account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\n",
       "from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\n",
       "know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\n",
       "family! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\n",
       "card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\n",
       "with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\n",
       "previous months of suspense and vexation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend's anxious\n",

       "happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\n",
       "father had been short and to the purpose.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\n",
       "and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed\n",
       "her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\n",
       "great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\n",
       "to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\n",
       "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\n",
       "expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\n",
       "basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\n",
       "Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\n",
       "himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\n",
       "Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\n",
       "made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\n",
       "her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or\n",
       "speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\n",
       "though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when\n",
       "Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\n",
       "how really happy he was.\n",
       "\n",
       "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\n",
       "visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\n",
       "turned to his daughter, and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\n",
       "goodness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\n",
       "thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\n",
       "doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\n",
       "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\n",
       "easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\n",
       "always exceed your income.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\n",
       "unpardonable in me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you\n",
       "talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\n",
       "more.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\n",
       "happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\n",
       "would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\n",
       "be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\n",
       "he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\n",
       "that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\n",
       "ever was seen!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\n",
       "favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\n",
       "sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\n",
       "which she might in future be able to dispense.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\n",
       "begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\n",
       "coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\n",
       "supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\n",
       "detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself\n",
       "obliged to accept.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\n",
       "while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;\n",
       "but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours\n",
       "of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he\n",
       "always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\n",
       "her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\n",
       "relief.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me that he\n",
       "was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\n",
       "it possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\n",
       "it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to\n",
       "his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\n",
       "chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\n",
       "as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\n",
       "learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\n",
       "can never be what we once were to each other.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\n",
       "heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\n",
       "the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\n",
       "he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\n",
       "indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\n",
       "modesty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\n",
       "the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased\n",
       "to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,\n",
       "though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she\n",
       "knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried\n",
       "Jane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\n",

       "\n",
       "\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\n",

       "The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\n",

       "The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\n",

       "\n",
       "One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\n",
       "formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\n",
       "dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\n",
       "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up\n",
       "the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\n",
       "equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\n",
       "were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\n",
       "preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\n",
       "somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\n",
       "the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\n",
       "shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\n",
       "continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\n",
       "open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\n",
       "astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\n",
       "Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\n",
       "inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\n",
       "\n",
       "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\n",
       "other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the\n",
       "head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\n",
       "name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\n",
       "introduction had been made.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\n",
       "high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\n",
       "for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\n",
       "mother.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\n",

       "who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short\n",

       "\n",
       "\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\n",
       "summer; the windows are full west.\"\n",

       "Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then\n",
       "added:\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\n",
       "letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\n",
       "refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\n",
       "declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and show her ladyship about the\n",

       "\n",
       "Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\n",
       "attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the\n",
       "hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\n",
       "drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\n",
       "looking rooms, walked on.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\n",
       "waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\n",
       "that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\n",
       "conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and\n",
       "disagreeable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in\n",
       "her face.\n",
       "\n",
       "As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\n",
       "manner:--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\n",
       "journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\n",
       "come.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\n",
       "for the honour of seeing you here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\n",
       "know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\n",
       "choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\n",
       "celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\n",
       "moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\n",
       "alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your\n",
       "sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n",
       "you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\n",
       "afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n",
       "_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\n",
       "so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved\n",
       "on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\n",
       "you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\n",
       "with astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\n",
       "so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth\n",
       "coolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\n",
       "is in existence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I never heard that it was.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may\n",
       "ask questions which I shall not choose to answer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\n",
       "reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\n",
       "have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\n",
       "may have drawn him in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\n",
       "language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\n",
       "and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,\n",
       "ever induce me to be explicit.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\n",
       "presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\n",
       "engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\n",
       "make an offer to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\n",
       "they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\n",
       "_his_ mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned\n",
       "the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\n",
       "be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\n",
       "inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\n",
       "the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\n",
       "tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\n",
       "propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest\n",
       "hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is\n",
       "no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not\n",
       "be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to\n",
       "marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\n",
       "marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither\n",
       "by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\n",
       "another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\n",

       "friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\n",
       "be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\n",

       "no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\n",
       "elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a\n",
       "patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\n",
       "such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his\n",

       "\n",

       "hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\n",
       "appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\n",
       "for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\n",
       "Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report\n",
       "of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\n",
       "till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\n",
       "and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\n",
       "expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\n",
       "the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\n",
       "sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours\n",
       "at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the\n",
       "Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady Catherine), had\n",

       "an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\n",
       "representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\n",
       "not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\n",
       "aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\n",
       "that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\n",
       "was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\n",
       "whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\n",
       "address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\n",
       "probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\n",

       "\n",
       "If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often\n",

       "settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\n",
       "unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\n",

       "her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\n",
       "happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\n",

       "been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\n",
       "expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\n",
       "but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\n",

       "every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,\n",
       "peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that\n",
       "such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise\n",

       "\n",
       "\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\n",
       "adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\n",
       "of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now\n",
       "so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\n",
       "circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\n",

       "innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude\n",
       "which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish\n",
       "being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I\n",
       "was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I\n",
       "was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.\n",

       "one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\n",
       "allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\n",

       "The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex.  Their estate\n",
       "was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of\n",
       "their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so\n",
       "respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their\n",
       "surrounding acquaintance.  The late owner of this estate was a single\n",
       "man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his\n",
       "life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister.  But her\n",
       "death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great\n",
       "alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received\n",
       "into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal\n",
       "inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to\n",
       "bequeath it.  In the society of his nephew and niece, and their\n",
       "children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent.  His\n",
       "attachment to them all increased.  The constant attention of Mr. and\n",
       "Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from\n",
       "interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid\n",
       "comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the\n",
       "children added a relish to his existence.\n",
       "\n",
       "By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present\n",
       "lady, three daughters.  The son, a steady respectable young man, was\n",
       "amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large,\n",
       "and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age.  By his own\n",
       "marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his\n",
       "wealth.  To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not\n",
       "so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent\n",
       "of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that\n",
       "property, could be but small.  Their mother had nothing, and their\n",
       "father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the\n",
       "remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her\n",

       "\n",
       "The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other\n",

       "he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the\n",
       "bequest.  Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife\n",
       "and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his\n",
       "son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as\n",
       "to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear\n",
       "to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or\n",
       "by any sale of its valuable woods.  The whole was tied up for the\n",
       "benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and\n",
       "mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by\n",
       "such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three\n",
       "years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his\n",
       "own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh\n",
       "all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received\n",
       "from his niece and her daughters.  He meant not to be unkind, however,\n",
       "and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a\n",

       "of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate\n",
       "improvement.  But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was\n",
       "his only one twelvemonth.  He survived his uncle no longer; and ten\n",

       "have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have\n",
       "been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and\n",
       "very fond of his wife.  But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature\n",
       "of himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.\n",

       "prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income,\n",
       "besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his\n",
       "heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- \"Yes, he would give\n",

       "be enough to make them completely easy.  Three thousand pounds! he\n",
       "could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience.\"-- He\n",

       "not repent.\n",

       "No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,\n",
       "without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law,\n",
       "arrived with her child and their attendants.  No one could dispute her\n",
       "right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his\n",

       "greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common\n",
       "feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was\n",
       "a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of\n",
       "the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of\n",
       "immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with\n",

       "not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the\n",
       "propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children\n",

       "enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,\n",
       "that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led\n",
       "to imprudence.  She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was\n",
       "affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern\n",

       "for, was created again and again.  They gave themselves up wholly to\n",
       "their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that\n",
       "could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in\n",
       "future.  Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could\n",

       "A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable.\"\n",

       "we shall be completely taken in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that\n",
       "purchase.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when\n",
       "there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy,\n",
       "and hardly forty.  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over\n",
       "and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it.  You are not\n",
       "aware of what you are doing.  I have known a great deal of the trouble\n",
       "of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to\n",
       "old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing how\n",
       "disagreeable she found it.  Twice every year these annuities were to be\n",
       "paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then\n",
       "one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be\n",
       "no such thing.  My mother was quite sick of it.  Her income was not her\n",
       "own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more\n",
       "unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been\n",
       "entirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever.  It\n",
       "has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would\n",
       "not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is certainly an unpleasant thing,\" replied Mr. Dashwood, \"to have\n",
       "those kind of yearly drains on one's income.  One's fortune, as your\n",
       "mother justly says, is NOT one's own.  To be tied down to the regular\n",
       "payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it\n",
       "takes away one's independence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it.  They think\n",
       "themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises\n",
       "no gratitude at all.  If I were you, whatever I did should be done at\n",
       "my own discretion entirely.  I would not bind myself to allow them any\n",
       "thing yearly.  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a\n",
       "hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should\n",
       "by no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will\n",
       "be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they\n",
       "would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger\n",
       "income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the\n",
       "year.  It will certainly be much the best way.  A present of fifty\n",
       "pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for\n",
       "money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To be sure it will.  Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within\n",
       "myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at\n",
       "all.  The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might\n",
       "be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a\n",
       "comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things,\n",
       "and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they\n",
       "are in season.  I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed,\n",
       "it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did.  Do but consider,\n",
       "my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law\n",
       "and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds,\n",
       "besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which\n",
       "brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will\n",
       "pay their mother for their board out of it.  Altogether, they will have\n",
       "five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want\n",
       "for more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will\n",
       "be nothing at all.  They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly\n",
       "any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of\n",
       "any kind!  Only conceive how comfortable they will be!  Five hundred a\n",
       "year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as\n",
       "to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it.  They will\n",
       "be much more able to give YOU something.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" said Mr. Dashwood, \"I believe you are perfectly right.\n",
       "My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than\n",
       "what you say.  I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil\n",
       "my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you\n",
       "have described.  When my mother removes into another house my services\n",
       "shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can.  Some little\n",
       "present of furniture too may be acceptable then.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" returned Mrs. John Dashwood.  \"But, however, ONE thing\n",
       "must be considered.  When your father and mother moved to Norland,\n",
       "though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and\n",
       "linen was saved, and is now left to your mother.  Her house will\n",
       "therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is a material consideration undoubtedly.  A valuable legacy\n",
       "indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant\n",
       "addition to our own stock here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what\n",
       "belongs to this house.  A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for\n",
       "any place THEY can ever afford to live in.  But, however, so it is.\n",
       "Your father thought only of THEM.  And I must say this: that you owe no\n",
       "particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very\n",
       "well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the\n",
       "world to THEM.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This argument was irresistible.  It gave to his intentions whatever of\n",
       "decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be\n",
       "absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the\n",
       "widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as\n",
       "his own wife pointed out.\n",

       "Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any\n",
       "disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased\n",
       "to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when\n",
       "her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other\n",
       "exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy\n",
       "remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her\n",
       "inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for\n",
       "to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible.  But she could\n",
       "hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and\n",
       "ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier\n",

       "her mother would have approved.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on\n",
       "the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last\n",
       "earthly reflections.  She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no\n",
       "more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her\n",
       "daughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was\n",
       "persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000L would support her in\n",
       "affluence.  For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his own\n",
       "heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his\n",
       "merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity.  His attentive\n",
       "behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare\n",
       "was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the\n",
       "liberality of his intentions.\n",
       "\n",
       "The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for\n",
       "her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge\n",
       "of her character, which half a year's residence in her family afforded;\n",
       "and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\n",
       "affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it\n",
       "impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular\n",

       "Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of\n",
       "interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died\n",
       "very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,\n",
       "for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the\n",
       "will of his mother.  But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either\n",
       "consideration.  It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable,\n",
       "that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality.\n",
       "It was contrary to every doctrine of her's that difference of fortune\n",
       "should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of\n",

       "to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome,\n",
       "his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart.\n",
       "His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid\n",
       "improvement.  But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to\n",
       "answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him\n",
       "distinguished--as--they hardly knew what.  They wanted him to make a\n",

       "see him connected with some of the great men of the day.  Mrs. John\n",
       "Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these\n",
       "superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her\n",
       "ambition to see him driving a barouche.  But Edward had no turn for\n",
       "great men or barouches.  All his wishes centered in domestic comfort\n",

       "\n",
       "Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged\n",
       "much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in such\n",
       "affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects.  She saw\n",
       "only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it.  He\n",
       "did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation.\n",
       "She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a\n",
       "reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference\n",

       "\"I think you will like him,\" said Elinor, \"when you know more of him.\"\n",

       "worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all\n",

       "who could seriously attach my sister.  His eyes want all that spirit,\n",
       "that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence.  And besides\n",
       "all this, I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real taste.  Music seems\n",
       "scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings very\n",
       "much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their\n",
       "worth.  It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while\n",
       "she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter.  He admires as\n",
       "a lover, not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy me, those characters must be\n",
       "united.  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every\n",
       "point coincide with my own.  He must enter into all my feelings; the\n",
       "same books, the same music must charm us both.  Oh! mama, how\n",
       "spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night!\n",
       "I felt for my sister most severely.  Yet she bore it with so much\n",
       "composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it.  I could hardly keep my\n",
       "seat.  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost\n",
       "driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such\n",
       "dreadful indifference!\"-- \"He would certainly have done more justice to\n",

       "performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means\n",
       "deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of\n",
       "improving it.  Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he\n",
       "would have drawn very well.  He distrusts his own judgment in such\n",

       "unreserved conversation.  The excellence of his understanding and his\n",
       "principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps\n",
       "him silent.  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth.\n",
       "But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from\n",
       "peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself.  He and I\n",
       "have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been\n",
       "wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother.  I\n",
       "have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard\n",

       "very high in her opinion.  She believed the regard to be mutual; but\n",
       "she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of\n",
       "their attachment agreeable to her.  She knew that what Marianne and her\n",
       "mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them,\n",

       "own feelings.  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared;\n",
       "believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--the\n",

       "improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be\n",
       "so indispensably necessary to your future felicity.  Oh! if he should\n",

       "Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister.  She could not\n",
       "consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne\n",
       "had believed it.  There was, at times, a want of spirits about him\n",
       "which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as\n",
       "unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not\n",

       "by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was\n",
       "still more common,) to make her uncivil.  She took the first\n",
       "opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to\n",
       "her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs.\n",

       "her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire.  The\n",
       "letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit\n",
       "of friendly accommodation.  He understood that she was in need of a\n",

       "whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses\n",
       "were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable\n",

       "county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours\n",
       "before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\n",
       "possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first\n",
       "recommendation.  To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an\n",
       "evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of\n",
       "the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for\n",
       "ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or\n",
       "visit it while such a woman was its mistress.  She instantly wrote Sir\n",
       "John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance\n",
       "of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her\n",

       "her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire.  The house, too, as\n",
       "described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so\n",

       "her, repeated, \"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there?  So far from\n",

       "She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood\n",

       "really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very\n",
       "exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his\n",
       "father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.-- The furniture\n",
       "was all sent around by water.  It chiefly consisted of household linen,\n",

       "death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage,\n",
       "she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest\n",

       "from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended\n",
       "no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland.  He so\n",

       "The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a\n",
       "disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant.  But as they\n",
       "drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a\n",
       "country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view\n",
       "of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness.  It was a\n",
       "pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture.  After winding\n",
       "along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.  A small\n",

       "\n",
       "As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact;\n",

       "the walls covered with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage led directly\n",
       "through the house into the garden behind.  On each side of the entrance\n",
       "was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the\n",
       "offices and the stairs.  Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest\n",
       "of the house.  It had not been built many years and was in good repair.\n",
       "In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but the tears\n",
       "which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon\n",
       "dried away.  They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their\n",
       "arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy.\n",
       "It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first\n",
       "seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an\n",
       "impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending\n",
       "it to their lasting approbation.\n",
       "\n",
       "The situation of the house was good.  High hills rose immediately\n",
       "behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open\n",
       "downs, the others cultivated and woody.  The village of Barton was\n",
       "chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the\n",
       "cottage windows.  The prospect in front was more extensive; it\n",
       "commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.\n",
       "The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that\n",
       "direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out\n",

       "delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply\n",
       "all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments.  \"As for the\n",
       "house itself, to be sure,\" said she, \"it is too small for our family,\n",

       "have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about\n",
       "building.  These parlors are both too small for such parties of our\n",
       "friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts\n",
       "of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the\n",
       "other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this,\n",
       "with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber\n",
       "and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage.  I could\n",
       "wish the stairs were handsome.  But one must not expect every thing;\n",
       "though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them.  I\n",

       "her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand.  The gentleman offered\n",
       "his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her\n",
       "situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther\n",
       "delay, and carried her down the hill.  Then passing through the garden,\n",
       "the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly\n",
       "into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his\n",
       "hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while\n",
       "the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret\n",
       "admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for\n",
       "his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so\n",
       "graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received\n",
       "additional charms from his voice and expression.  Had he been even old,\n",
       "ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would\n",
       "have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the\n",
       "influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the\n",
       "action which came home to her feelings.\n",
       "\n",
       "She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which\n",
       "always attended her, invited him to be seated.  But this he declined,\n",
       "as he was dirty and wet.  Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she\n",
       "was obliged.  His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present\n",
       "home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the\n",
       "honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood.  The honour\n",
       "was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more\n",
       "interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.\n",
       "\n",
       "His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the\n",
       "theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\n",
       "against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\n",
       "attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his person that the\n",
       "rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting\n",
       "her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their\n",
       "entering the house.  But she had seen enough of him to join in all the\n",
       "admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her\n",
       "praise.  His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\n",
       "for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\n",
       "house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of\n",
       "thought which particularly recommended the action to her.  Every\n",
       "circumstance belonging to him was interesting.  His name was good, his\n",
       "residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that\n",
       "of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming.  Her\n",
       "imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a\n",
       "sprained ankle was disregarded.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather\n",
       "that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident\n",
       "being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any\n",
       "gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Willoughby!\" cried Sir John; \"what, is HE in the country? That is good\n",
       "news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on\n",
       "Thursday.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You know him then,\" said Mrs. Dashwood.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Know him! to be sure I do.  Why, he is down here every year.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what sort of a young man is he?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you.  A very decent\n",
       "shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And is that all you can say for him?\" cried Marianne, indignantly.\n",
       "\"But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his\n",
       "pursuits, his talents, and genius?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir John was rather puzzled.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my soul,\" said he, \"I do not know much about him as to all THAT.\n",
       "But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest\n",
       "little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.  Was she out with him\n",
       "today?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr.\n",
       "Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his\n",
       "mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But who is he?\" said Elinor.  \"Where does he come from?  Has he a\n",
       "house at Allenham?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he\n",
       "told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the\n",
       "country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady\n",
       "at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was\n",
       "to inherit; adding, \"Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can\n",
       "tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in\n",
       "Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my\n",
       "younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills.  Miss\n",
       "Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself.  Brandon will\n",
       "be jealous, if she does not take care.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not believe,\" said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,\n",
       "\"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY\n",
       "daughters towards what you call CATCHING him.  It is not an employment\n",
       "to which they have been brought up.  Men are very safe with us, let\n",
       "them be ever so rich.  I am glad to find, however, from what you say,\n",
       "that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not\n",
       "be ineligible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,\" repeated\n",
       "Sir John.  \"I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he\n",
       "danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did he indeed?\" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, \"and with\n",
       "elegance, with spirit?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be.  Whatever\n",
       "be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and\n",
       "leave him no sense of fatigue.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,\" said Sir John, \"I see how it will be.\n",
       "You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor\n",
       "Brandon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is an expression, Sir John,\" said Marianne, warmly, \"which I\n",
       "particularly dislike.  I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit\n",
       "is intended; and 'setting one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,'\n",
       "are the most odious of all.  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and\n",
       "if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago\n",
       "destroyed all its ingenuity.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as\n",
       "heartily as if he did, and then replied,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other.\n",
       "Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,\n",
       "styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make\n",
       "his personal enquiries.  He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more\n",
       "than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and\n",
       "her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the\n",
       "visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection,\n",
       "and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced\n",
       "him.  Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview\n",
       "to be convinced.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a\n",
       "remarkably pretty figure.  Marianne was still handsomer.  Her form,\n",
       "though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of\n",
       "height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the\n",
       "common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less\n",
       "violently outraged than usually happens.  Her skin was very brown, but,\n",
       "from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her\n",
       "features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her\n",
       "eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,\n",
       "which could hardily be seen without delight.  From Willoughby their\n",
       "expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the\n",
       "remembrance of his assistance created.  But when this passed away, when\n",
       "her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect\n",
       "good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and\n",
       "above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was\n",
       "passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured\n",
       "the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her\n",
       "to talk.  She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and\n",
       "she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion.  They speedily\n",
       "discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and\n",
       "that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related\n",
       "to either.  Encouraged by this to a further examination of his\n",
       "opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her\n",
       "favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous\n",
       "a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been\n",
       "insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence\n",
       "of such works, however disregarded before.  Their taste was strikingly\n",
       "alike.  The same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or if\n",
       "any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than\n",
       "till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be\n",
       "displayed.  He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her\n",
       "enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with\n",
       "the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Marianne,\" said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, \"for ONE\n",
       "morning I think you have done pretty well.  You have already\n",
       "ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of\n",
       "importance.  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are\n",
       "certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have\n",
       "received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper.\n",
       "But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such\n",
       "extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse?  You will soon\n",
       "have exhausted each favourite topic.  Another meeting will suffice to\n",
       "explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and\n",
       "then you can have nothing farther to ask.\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Elinor,\" cried Marianne, \"is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so\n",
       "scanty?  But I see what you mean.  I have been too much at my ease, too\n",
       "happy, too frank.  I have erred against every common-place notion of\n",
       "decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been\n",
       "reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of the\n",
       "weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this\n",
       "reproach would have been spared.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My love,\" said her mother, \"you must not be offended with Elinor--she\n",
       "was only in jest.  I should scold her myself, if she were capable of\n",
       "wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new\n",
       "friend.\"-- Marianne was softened in a moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their\n",
       "acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer.  He\n",
       "came to them every day.  To enquire after Marianne was at first his\n",
       "excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave\n",
       "greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased\n",
       "to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery.  She was confined for\n",
       "some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less\n",
       "irksome.  Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick\n",
       "imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners.  He was\n",
       "exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined\n",
       "not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was\n",
       "now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which\n",
       "recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.\n",
       "\n",
       "His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment.  They read,\n",
       "they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable;\n",
       "and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had\n",
       "unfortunately wanted.\n",
       "\n",
       "In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's; and\n",
       "Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he\n",
       "strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too\n",
       "much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or\n",
       "circumstances.  In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other\n",
       "people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided\n",
       "attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the\n",
       "forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor\n",
       "could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in\n",
       "its support.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized\n",
       "her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her\n",
       "ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable.  Willoughby was\n",
       "all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every\n",
       "brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour\n",
       "declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities\n",
       "were strong.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their\n",
       "marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the\n",
       "end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate\n",
       "herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.\n",
       "\n",
       "Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early been\n",
       "discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when\n",
       "it ceased to be noticed by them.  Their attention and wit were drawn\n",
       "off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had\n",
       "incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings\n",
       "began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.\n",
       "Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments\n",
       "which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now\n",
       "actually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance\n",
       "of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.\n",
       "Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no\n",
       "hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw it with concern;\n",
       "for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a\n",
       "very lively one of five and twenty? and as she could not even wish him\n",
       "successful, she heartily wished him indifferent.  She liked him--in\n",
       "spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of\n",
       "interest.  His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve\n",
       "appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any\n",
       "natural gloominess of temper.  Sir John had dropped hints of past\n",
       "injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being\n",
       "an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by\n",
       "Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither\n",
       "lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Brandon is just the kind of man,\" said Willoughby one day, when they\n",
       "were talking of him together, \"whom every body speaks well of, and\n",
       "nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers\n",
       "to talk to.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is exactly what I think of him,\" cried Marianne.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not boast of it, however,\" said Elinor, \"for it is injustice in\n",
       "both of you.  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and\n",
       "I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby, \"is certainly in\n",
       "his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in\n",
       "itself.  Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a\n",
       "woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the\n",
       "indifference of any body else?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will\n",
       "make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother.  If their\n",
       "praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more\n",
       "undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In defence of your protege you can even be saucy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always\n",
       "have attractions for me.  Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty\n",
       "and forty.  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has\n",
       "read, and has a thinking mind.  I have found him capable of giving me\n",
       "much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my\n",
       "inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is to say,\" cried Marianne contemptuously, \"he has told you, that\n",
       "in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are\n",
       "troublesome.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries,\n",
       "but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps,\" said Willoughby, \"his observations may have extended to the\n",
       "existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further\n",
       "than your candour.  But why should you dislike him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not dislike him.  I consider him, on the contrary, as a very\n",
       "respectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice;\n",
       "who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to\n",
       "employ, and two new coats every year.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Add to which,\" cried Marianne, \"that he has neither genius, taste, nor\n",
       "spirit.  That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no\n",
       "ardour, and his voice no expression.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass,\" replied Elinor,\n",
       "\"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the\n",
       "commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and\n",
       "insipid.  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred,\n",
       "well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable\n",
       "heart.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Dashwood,\" cried Willoughby, \"you are now using me unkindly.  You\n",
       "are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my\n",
       "will.  But it will not do.  You shall find me as stubborn as you can be\n",
       "artful.  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel\n",
       "Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has\n",
       "found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him\n",
       "to buy my brown mare.  If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,\n",
       "to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects\n",
       "irreproachable, I am ready to confess it.  And in return for an\n",

       "Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came\n",
       "into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their\n",
       "time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such\n",
       "frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\n",
       "leisure for serious employment.  Yet such was the case.  When Marianne\n",
       "was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir\n",
       "John had been previously forming, were put into execution.  The private\n",
       "balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and\n",
       "accomplished as often as a showery October would allow.  In every\n",
       "meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and\n",
       "familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly\n",
       "calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\n",
       "Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of\n",
       "Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving,\n",
       "in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her\n",
       "affection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment.  She only wished\n",
       "that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to\n",
       "suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne\n",
       "abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve;\n",
       "and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves\n",
       "illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a\n",
       "disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions.\n",
       "Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an\n",
       "illustration of their opinions.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he was present she had no eyes for any one else.  Every thing he\n",
       "did, was right.  Every thing he said, was clever.  If their evenings at\n",
       "the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest\n",
       "of the party to get her a good hand.  If dancing formed the amusement\n",
       "of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to\n",
       "separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and\n",
       "scarcely spoke a word to any body else.  Such conduct made them of\n",
       "course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and\n",
       "seemed hardly to provoke them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left\n",
       "her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them.  To her\n",

       "This was the season of happiness to Marianne.  Her heart was devoted to\n",
       "Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with\n",
       "her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it\n",
       "possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her\n",
       "present home.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor's happiness was not so great.  Her heart was not so much at\n",
       "ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure.  They afforded\n",
       "her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind,\n",
       "nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than\n",
       "ever.  Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the\n",
       "conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker,\n",
       "and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a\n",
       "large share of her discourse.  She had already repeated her own history\n",
       "to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal to\n",
       "her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their\n",
       "acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jenning's last illness, and\n",
       "what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died.  Lady Middleton\n",
       "was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent.  Elinor\n",
       "needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere\n",
       "calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do.  Towards her\n",
       "husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was\n",
       "therefore neither to be looked for nor desired.  She had nothing to say\n",
       "one day that she had not said the day before.  Her insipidity was\n",
       "invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she\n",
       "did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every\n",
       "thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her,\n",
       "she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might\n",
       "have experienced in sitting at home;--and so little did her presence\n",
       "add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation,\n",
       "that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her\n",
       "solicitude about her troublesome boys.\n",
       "\n",
       "In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find\n",
       "a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite\n",
       "the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion.\n",
       "Willoughby was out of the question.  Her admiration and regard, even\n",
       "her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his\n",
       "attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might\n",
       "have been more generally pleasing.  Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for\n",
       "himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in\n",
       "conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\n",
       "indifference of her sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect\n",
       "that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him.\n",
       "This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from\n",
       "him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by\n",
       "mutual consent, while the others were dancing.  His eyes were fixed on\n",
       "Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint\n",
       "smile, \"Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No,\" replied Elinor, \"her opinions are all romantic.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I believe she does.  But how she contrives it without reflecting on\n",
       "the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not.\n",
       "A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of\n",
       "common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define\n",
       "and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This will probably be the case,\" he replied; \"and yet there is\n",
       "something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is\n",
       "sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot agree with you there,\" said Elinor.  \"There are\n",
       "inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the\n",
       "charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for.  Her\n",
       "systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at\n",
       "nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward\n",
       "to as her greatest possible advantage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a\n",
       "second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body?  Are those\n",
       "who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the\n",
       "inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be\n",
       "equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles.\n",
       "I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second\n",
       "attachment's being pardonable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\n",
       "sentiments--No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements\n",
       "of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they\n",
       "succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous!  I\n",
       "speak from experience.  I once knew a lady who in temper and mind\n",
       "greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who\n",
       "from an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances\"--\n",
       "Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,\n",
       "and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not\n",
       "otherwise have entered Elinor's head.  The lady would probably have\n",
       "passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what\n",
       "concerned her ought not to escape his lips.  As it was, it required but\n",
       "a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender\n",
       "recollection of past regard.  Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne,\n",
       "in her place, would not have done so little.  The whole story would\n",
       "have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing\n",
       "established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.\n",

       "\n",
       "As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the\n",
       "latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of\n",
       "all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought,\n",
       "surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both.  Marianne told her,\n",
       "with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one\n",
       "that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was\n",
       "exactly calculated to carry a woman.  Without considering that it was\n",
       "not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter\n",
       "her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the\n",
       "servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable\n",

       "\n",

       "she added, \"and when it arrives we will ride every day.  You shall\n",

       "delight of a gallop on some of these downs.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to\n",
       "comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for\n",
       "some time she refused to submit to them.  As to an additional servant,\n",
       "the expense would be a trifle; Mamma she was sure would never object to\n",
       "it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the\n",

       "ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a\n",
       "man so little, or at least so lately known to her.  This was too much.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are mistaken, Elinor,\" said she warmly, \"in supposing I know very\n",
       "little of Willoughby.  I have not known him long indeed, but I am much\n",
       "better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the\n",
       "world, except yourself and mama.  It is not time or opportunity that is\n",
       "to determine intimacy;--it is disposition alone.  Seven years would be\n",
       "insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven\n",
       "days are more than enough for others.  I should hold myself guilty of\n",
       "greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from\n",

       "mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she\n",
       "consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly\n",

       "him next, that it must be declined.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the\n",
       "cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to\n",
       "him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his\n",
       "present.  The reasons for this alteration were at the same time\n",
       "related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side\n",
       "impossible.  His concern however was very apparent; and after\n",
       "expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--\"But,\n",
       "Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now.  I\n",
       "shall keep it only till you can claim it.  When you leave Barton to\n",

       "sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her\n",
       "sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so\n",
       "decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between\n",
       "them.  From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each\n",
       "other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or\n",

       "\n",
       "Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this\n",

       "evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour\n",
       "with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,\n",
       "which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest\n",
       "sister, when they were next by themselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Elinor!\" she cried, \"I have such a secret to tell you about\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You have said so,\" replied Elinor, \"almost every day since they first\n",
       "met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I\n",
       "believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round\n",
       "her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great\n",
       "uncle.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But indeed this is quite another thing.  I am sure they will be\n",

       "of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could\n",
       "be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took\n",
       "up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all\n",

       "\n",
       "Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory\n",

       "favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her,\n",

       "tell, may I, Elinor?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.\n",

       "standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good\n",

       "\n",

       "Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of\n",

       "worse.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, ma'am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I am particularly sorry, ma'am,\" said he, addressing Lady Middleton,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"In town!\" cried Mrs. Jennings.  \"What can you have to do in town at\n",
       "this time of year?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My own loss is great,\" he continued, \"in being obliged to leave so\n",

       "\n",
       "\"We must go,\" said Sir John.--\"It shall not be put off when we are so\n",

       "are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure.  Brandon is one of\n",
       "them.  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this\n",

       "\"Well, then, when will you come back again?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto\n",

       "\"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have\n",
       "heard of her before.  She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a\n",
       "very near relation.  We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the\n",
       "young ladies.\" Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor,\n",
       "\"She is his natural daughter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare.  I dare say the Colonel\n",

       "\n",
       "When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret\n",
       "on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as\n",
       "they were all got together, they must do something by way of being\n",
       "happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although\n",
       "happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a\n",
       "tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country.  The\n",
       "carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never\n",
       "looked happier than when she got into it.  He drove through the park\n",
       "very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them\n",
       "was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return\n",
       "of all the rest.  They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said\n",
       "only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others\n",
       "went on the downs.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that\n",
       "every body should be extremely merry all day long.  Some more of the\n",
       "Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly\n",
       "twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.\n",
       "Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been long\n",
       "seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to\n",
       "Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, \"I have found you out in\n",
       "spite of all your tricks.  I know where you spent the morning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, \"Where, pray?\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did not you know,\" said Willoughby, \"that we had been out in my\n",
       "curricle?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined\n",
       "to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, Miss\n",
       "Marianne.  It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you,\n",
       "I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when\n",
       "I was there six years ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne turned away in great confusion.  Mrs. Jennings laughed\n",
       "heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they\n",
       "had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr.\n",
       "Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that\n",
       "they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in\n",
       "walking about the garden and going all over the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely\n",
       "that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house\n",
       "while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest\n",
       "acquaintance.\n",
       "\n",
       "As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it;\n",
       "and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance\n",
       "related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true.  Marianne was quite angry\n",
       "with her for doubting it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we\n",
       "did not see the house?  Is not it what you have often wished to do\n",
       "yourself?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with\n",
       "no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew\n",
       "that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to\n",
       "have any other companion.  I never spent a pleasanter morning in my\n",
       "life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am afraid,\" replied Elinor, \"that the pleasantness of an employment\n",
       "does not always evince its propriety.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if\n",
       "there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been\n",
       "sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting\n",
       "wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very\n",
       "impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of\n",
       "your own conduct?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of\n",
       "impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.\n",
       "I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation.  I\n",
       "am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.\n",
       "Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house.  They will one day be Mr.\n",
       "Willoughby's, and--\"\n",
       "\n",

       "justified in what you have done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her;\n",
       "and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to her\n",
       "sister again, and said with great good humour, \"Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS\n",
       "rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted\n",
       "particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure\n",
       "you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice\n",
       "comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would\n",
       "be delightful.  It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.  On\n",
       "one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a\n",
       "beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church\n",
       "and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so\n",
       "often admired.  I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be\n",
       "more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a\n",
       "couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the\n",
       "pleasantest summer-rooms in England.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others,\n",

       "\n",
       "The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his\n",
       "steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the\n",
       "wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great\n",
       "wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all\n",
       "the comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  She wondered, with\n",
       "little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must\n",
       "be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could\n",
       "have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape\n",
       "them all.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,\" said she.\n",
       "\"I could see it in his face.  Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances\n",
       "may be bad.  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two\n",
       "thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved.  I do\n",
       "think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can\n",
       "it be?  I wonder whether it is so.  I would give anything to know the\n",
       "truth of it.  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare\n",
       "say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her.  May be\n",
       "she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a\n",
       "notion she is always rather sickly.  I would lay any wager it is about\n",
       "Miss Williams.  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his\n",
       "circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must\n",
       "have cleared the estate by this time.  I wonder what it can be!  May be\n",
       "his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  His setting\n",
       "off in such a hurry seems very like it.  Well, I wish him out of all\n",
       "his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  Her opinion varying with every\n",
       "fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.\n",
       "Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel\n",
       "Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away,\n",
       "which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the\n",
       "circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or\n",
       "variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of.  It was\n",
       "engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on\n",
       "the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them\n",
       "all.  As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange\n",
       "and more incompatible with the disposition of both.  Why they should\n",
       "not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant\n",
       "behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not\n",
       "imagine.\n",
       "\n",
       "She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in\n",
       "their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason\n",
       "to believe him rich.  His estate had been rated by Sir John at about\n",
       "six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that\n",
       "income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of\n",
       "his poverty.  But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them\n",
       "relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,\n",
       "she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their\n",
       "general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind\n",
       "of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her\n",
       "making any inquiry of Marianne.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than\n",
       "Willoughby's behaviour.  To Marianne it had all the distinguishing\n",
       "tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the\n",
       "family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother.  The\n",
       "cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more\n",
       "of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general\n",
       "engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him\n",
       "out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest\n",
       "of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his\n",
       "favourite pointer at her feet.\n",
       "\n",
       "One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the\n",
       "country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of\n",
       "attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening\n",
       "to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly\n",
       "opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as\n",
       "perfect with him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What!\" he exclaimed--\"Improve this dear cottage!  No. THAT I will\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Miss Dashwood, \"nothing of the kind will be\n",

       "sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one\n",
       "whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world.  Depend upon it\n",
       "that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in\n",
       "the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it\n",
       "in a manner so painful to you.  But are you really so attached to this\n",

       "\"Yes,\" cried he in the same eager tone, \"with all and every thing\n",
       "belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about it,\n",
       "should the least variation be perceptible.  Then, and then only, under\n",

       "\"There certainly are circumstances,\" said Willoughby, \"which might\n",
       "greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of\n",
       "my affection, which no other can possibly share.\"\n",

       "should live in it.  How little did I then think that the very first\n",
       "news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country,\n",
       "would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate\n",
       "satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of\n",
       "prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account\n",
       "for.  Must it not have been so, Marianne?\" speaking to her in a lowered\n",

       "imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance\n",
       "first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by\n",
       "us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance,\n",
       "and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has\n",
       "hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort\n",
       "than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world\n",
       "could possibly afford.\"\n",

       "easy.  Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy.  Tell me\n",
       "that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever\n",
       "find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will\n",
       "always consider me with the kindness which has made everything\n",
       "belonging to you so dear to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the\n",
       "whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.\n",
       "\n",

       "her conjecture had been just.  So far it was all as she had foreseen;\n",
       "but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her\n",
       "to expect.  They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came\n",
       "hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her\n",
       "handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.\n",
       "Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had\n",

       "the mantel-piece with his back towards them.  He turned round on their\n",

       "cousin, by sending me on business to London.  I have just received my\n",
       "dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of\n",
       "exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you.\"\n",

       "Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise.  Elinor felt equal\n",

       "first spoke.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you\n",
       "will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here\n",
       "immediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing\n",

       "your judgment than to doubt your inclination.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another\n",
       "pause succeeded.  This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint\n",
       "smile, \"It is folly to linger in this manner.  I will not torment\n",
       "myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is\n",
       "impossible for me now to enjoy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room.  They saw him\n",
       "step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the\n",
       "parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this\n",
       "sudden departure occasioned.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's.  She thought of\n",
       "what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.  Willoughby's behaviour\n",
       "in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of\n",
       "cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's\n",
       "invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself,\n",
       "greatly disturbed her.  One moment she feared that no serious design\n",
       "had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate\n",
       "quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;--the distress in\n",
       "which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could\n",
       "most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne's\n",
       "love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.\n",
       "\n",
       "But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister's\n",
       "affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest\n",
       "compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability\n",
       "not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a\n",
       "duty.\n",
       "\n",
       "In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were\n",
       "red, her countenance was not uncheerful.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor,\" said she,\n",
       "as she sat down to work, \"and with how heavy a heart does he travel?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is all very strange.  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work\n",
       "of a moment.  And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so\n",
       "affectionate?  And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without\n",
       "intending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must have\n",
       "happened.  He did not speak, he did not behave like himself.  YOU must\n",
       "have seen the difference as well as I.  What can it be?  Can they have\n",
       "quarrelled?  Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept\n",
       "your invitation here?\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see\n",
       "THAT.  He had not the power of accepting it.  I have thought it all\n",
       "over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at\n",
       "first seemed strange to me as well as to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can you, indeed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes. I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but\n",
       "you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU,\n",
       "I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it.  I am\n",
       "persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves\n",
       "of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that\n",
       "account is eager to get him away;--and that the business which she\n",
       "sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him.\n",
       "This is what I believe to have happened.  He is, moreover, aware that\n",
       "she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present\n",
       "confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself\n",
       "obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and\n",
       "absent himself from Devonshire for a while.  You will tell me, I know,\n",
       "that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil,\n",
       "unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair\n",
       "as satisfactory at this.  And now, Elinor, what have you to say?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened.\n",
       "Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings!  You had rather\n",
       "take evil upon credit than good.  You had rather look out for misery\n",
       "for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the\n",
       "latter.  You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave\n",
       "of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn.  And is\n",
       "no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by\n",
       "recent disappointment?  Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely\n",
       "because they are not certainties?  Is nothing due to the man whom we\n",
       "have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill\n",
       "of?  To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though\n",
       "unavoidably secret for a while?  And, after all, what is it you suspect\n",
       "him of?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can hardly tell myself.  But suspicion of something unpleasant is\n",
       "the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed\n",
       "in him.  There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of\n",
       "the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be\n",
       "candid in my judgment of every body.  Willoughby may undoubtedly have\n",
       "very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has.\n",
       "But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at\n",
       "once.  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at\n",
       "its being practiced by him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the\n",
       "deviation is necessary.  But you really do admit the justice of what I\n",
       "have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not entirely.  It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they\n",
       "ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that is the case, it must be\n",
       "highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at\n",
       "present.  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Concealing it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and\n",
       "Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have\n",
       "been reproaching them every day for incautiousness.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last\n",
       "fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future\n",
       "wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation?\n",
       "Have we not perfectly understood each other?  Has not my consent been\n",
       "daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate\n",
       "respect?  My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement?  How\n",
       "could such a thought occur to you?  How is it to be supposed that\n",
       "Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leave\n",
       "her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his\n",

       "confidence?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that every circumstance except ONE is in\n",
       "favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both\n",
       "on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How strange this is!  You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby,\n",
       "if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the\n",
       "nature of the terms on which they are together.  Has he been acting a\n",
       "part in his behaviour to your sister all this time?  Do you suppose him\n",
       "really indifferent to her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I cannot think that.  He must and does love her I am sure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this\n",
       "matter as certain.  I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are\n",
       "fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away.  If we\n",
       "find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A mighty concession indeed!  If you were to see them at the altar, you\n",

       "require no such proof.  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to\n",
       "justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly\n",
       "open and unreserved.  You cannot doubt your sister's wishes.  It must\n",

       "manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did not\n",
       "return your kindness with any cordiality.  But all this may be\n",
       "explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed.  He\n",

       "case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more\n",
       "to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general\n",
       "character;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct\n",
       "on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself,\n",

       "Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately,\n",
       "it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging\n",
       "everything to me at once: but this is not the case.  It is an\n",
       "engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage\n",

       "\n",

       "the revealment of it eligible.  I would not attempt to force the\n",

       "prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of\n",
       "wandering away by herself.  Hitherto she had carefully avoided every\n",
       "companion in her rambles.  If her sisters intended to walk on the\n",
       "downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the\n",
       "valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be\n",
       "found when the others set off.  But at length she was secured by the\n",
       "exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.\n",
       "They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,\n",
       "for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with\n",
       "gaining one point, would not then attempt more.  Beyond the entrance of\n",

       "more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first\n",
       "coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they\n",
       "stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the\n",
       "distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had\n",
       "never happened to reach in any of their walks before.\n",
       "\n",
       "Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;\n",
       "it was a man on horseback riding towards them.  In a few minutes they\n",
       "could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards\n",
       "Marianne rapturously exclaimed,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!\"--and was hastening to meet\n",
       "him, when Elinor cried out,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.  It is not Willoughby.\n",
       "The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He has, he has,\" cried Marianne, \"I am sure he has.  His air, his\n",

       "\n",
       "She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from\n",
       "particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,\n",
       "quickened her pace and kept up with her.  They were soon within thirty\n",
       "yards of the gentleman.  Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within\n",
       "her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices\n",
       "of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well\n",
       "known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and she\n",
       "turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be\n",
       "forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a\n",
       "smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her\n",
       "sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.\n",
       "\n",
       "He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with\n",
       "them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by\n",
       "Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than\n",
       "even Elinor herself.  To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward\n",
       "and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness\n",
       "which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour.  On\n",
       "Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a\n",
       "lover ought to look and say on such an occasion.  He was confused,\n",
       "seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither\n",
       "rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by\n",
       "questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection.  Marianne\n",
       "saw and listened with increasing surprise.  She began almost to feel a\n",
       "dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by\n",
       "carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a\n",
       "contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries\n",
       "of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London.  No,\n",
       "he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A fortnight!\" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same\n",
       "county with Elinor without seeing her before.\n",
       "\n",
       "He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with\n",
       "some friends near Plymouth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have you been lately in Sussex?\" said Elinor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was at Norland about a month ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And how does dear, dear Norland look?\" cried Marianne.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dear, dear Norland,\" said Elinor, \"probably looks much as it always\n",
       "does at this time of the year.  The woods and walks thickly covered\n",
       "with dead leaves.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh,\" cried Marianne, \"with what transporting sensation have I formerly\n",
       "seen them fall!  How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven\n",
       "in showers about me by the wind!  What feelings have they, the season,\n",
       "the air altogether inspired!  Now there is no one to regard them.  They\n",
       "are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as\n",
       "possible from the sight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is not every one,\" said Elinor, \"who has your passion for dead\n",
       "leaves.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood.  But\n",
       "SOMETIMES they are.\"--As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a\n",
       "few moments;--but rousing herself again, \"Now, Edward,\" said she,\n",
       "calling his attention to the prospect, \"here is Barton valley.  Look up\n",
       "to it, and be tranquil if you can.  Look at those hills!  Did you ever\n",
       "see their equals?  To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and\n",
       "plantations.  You may see the end of the house.  And there, beneath\n",
       "that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a beautiful country,\" he replied; \"but these bottoms must be\n",

       "\n",
       "\"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Because,\" replied he, smiling, \"among the rest of the objects before\n",
       "me, I see a very dirty lane.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How strange!\" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.\n",

       "\"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here?  Are the Middletons pleasant\n",
       "people?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Marianne,\" cried her sister, \"how can you say so? How can you be so\n",
       "unjust?  They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards\n",
       "us have behaved in the friendliest manner.  Have you forgot, Marianne,\n",
       "how many pleasant days we have owed to them?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said Marianne, in a low voice, \"nor how many painful moments.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their\n",
       "visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by\n",
       "talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting\n",
       "from him occasional questions and remarks.  His coldness and reserve\n",
       "mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to\n",
       "regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she\n",
       "avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him\n",
       "as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.\n",

       "coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural.\n",
       "Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder.  He received\n",
       "the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not\n",
       "stand against such a reception.  They had begun to fail him before he\n",
       "entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating\n",
       "manners of Mrs. Dashwood.  Indeed a man could not very well be in love\n",
       "with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and\n",
       "Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like\n",
       "himself.  His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his\n",
       "interest in their welfare again became perceptible.  He was not in\n",
       "spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was\n",
       "attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits.  The whole family\n",
       "perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of\n",
       "liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all\n",
       "selfish parents.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?\" said she,\n",
       "when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; \"are you still\n",
       "to be a great orator in spite of yourself?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than\n",

       "it a difficult matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall not attempt it.  I have no wish to be distinguished; and have\n",
       "every reason to hope I never shall.  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You have no ambition, I well know.  Your wishes are all moderate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe.  I wish as\n",
       "well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body\n",
       "else it must be in my own way.  Greatness will not make me so.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Elinor, for shame!\" said Marianne, \"money can only give happiness\n",
       "where there is nothing else to give it.  Beyond a competence, it can\n",
       "afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps,\" said Elinor, smiling, \"we may come to the same point.  YOUR\n",
       "competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without\n",
       "them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of\n",
       "external comfort must be wanting.  Your ideas are only more noble than\n",
       "mine.  Come, what is your competence?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT.\"\n",

       "general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as\n",
       "for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music\n",
       "enough in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, Cowper,\n",
       "Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up\n",
       "every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands;\n",
       "and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old\n",
       "twisted tree.  Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive me, if I am very\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward--whether it be melancholy or\n",

       "unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished\n",
       "her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of\n",
       "inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very\n",

       "picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste\n",
       "if we come to particulars.  I shall call hills steep, which ought to be\n",
       "bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and\n",
       "rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be\n",
       "indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere.  You must be\n",
       "satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give.  I call it a\n",
       "very fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine\n",
       "timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadows\n",
       "and several neat farm houses scattered here and there.  It exactly\n",
       "answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with\n",
       "utility--and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire\n",
       "it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey\n",

       "feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater\n",
       "indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It is very true,\" said Marianne, \"that admiration of landscape scenery\n",

       "his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait\n",

       "how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought\n",
       "could not be surpassed by his.  He coloured very deeply, and giving a\n",
       "momentary glance at Elinor, replied, \"Yes; it is my sister's hair.  The\n",
       "setting always casts a different shade on it, you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise.  That the hair\n",
       "was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;\n",
       "the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne\n",
       "considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must\n",
       "have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself.\n",
       "She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and\n",
       "affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of\n",
       "something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every\n",
       "opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all\n",

       "\n",
       "Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of\n",
       "mind still more settled.  He was particularly grave the whole morning.\n",
       "Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own\n",

       "self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment\n",
       "among his friends was at the height.  His spirits, during the last two\n",
       "or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he\n",
       "grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of\n",
       "going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly\n",
       "disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left\n",
       "them--but still, go he must.  Never had any week passed so quickly--he\n",

       "lie to his actions.  He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being\n",

       "Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his\n",

       "character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse\n",
       "for every thing strange on the part of her son.  Disappointed, however,\n",

       "his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications,\n",
       "which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for\n",
       "Willoughby's service, by her mother.  His want of spirits, of openness,\n",
       "and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of\n",
       "independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition\n",
       "and designs.  The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose\n",
       "in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same\n",
       "inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother.  The old\n",
       "well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child,\n",
       "was the cause of all.  She would have been glad to know when these\n",
       "difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs.\n",
       "Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy.  But\n",

       "of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of every\n",
       "mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and\n",

       "\n",

       "heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage\n",
       "me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like\n",
       "independence.  But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my\n",
       "friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being.  We never\n",
       "could agree in our choice of a profession.  I always preferred the\n",
       "church, as I still do.  But that was not smart enough for my family.\n",
       "They recommended the army.  That was a great deal too smart for me.\n",
       "The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had\n",
       "chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first\n",
       "circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs.  But I had no\n",
       "inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which\n",
       "my family approved.  As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I\n",
       "was too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, at\n",
       "length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,\n",
       "as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as\n",
       "with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous\n",
       "and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so\n",
       "earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\n",
       "friends to do nothing.  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been\n",
       "properly idle ever since.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The consequence of which, I suppose, will be,\" said Mrs. Dashwood,\n",
       "\"since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will\n",
       "be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades\n",
       "as Columella's.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They will be brought up,\" said he, in a serious accent, \"to be as\n",

       "yourself must be happy.  But remember that the pain of parting from\n",
       "friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their\n",
       "education or state.  Know your own happiness.  You want nothing but\n",
       "patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope.  Your\n",
       "mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so\n",
       "anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her\n",

       "\n",
       "This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to\n",

       "But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself\n",
       "from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his\n",
       "going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by\n",
       "Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by\n",
       "seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  Their means were as different\n",

       "\n",
       "Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the\n",

       "avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as\n",
       "much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this\n",
       "conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented\n",
       "from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much\n",
       "solicitude on her account.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no\n",
       "more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her.\n",

       "That her sister's affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though she\n",
       "blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a\n",
       "very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in\n",

       "variety which the different state of her spirits at different times\n",

       "be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so\n",

       "her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the\n",

       "but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown\n",
       "to her.  She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John\n",
       "perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of\n",
       "knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open\n",
       "the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the\n",

       "possibly be.  Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's,\n",

       "smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled\n",
       "when she went away.  Her husband was a grave looking young man of five\n",
       "or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife,\n",
       "but of less willingness to please or be pleased.  He entered the room\n",
       "with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without\n",
       "speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their\n",

       "continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing\n",
       "their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told.  Mrs. Palmer\n",
       "laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every\n",

       "for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for\n",
       "you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was\n",
       "wrong in her situation.  I wanted her to stay at home and rest this\n",

       "appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so\n",
       "heartily at the question, as to show she understood it.  Mr. Palmer\n",
       "looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and\n",
       "then returned to his newspaper.  Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by\n",

       "her daughters might do as they pleased.  But they had no curiosity to\n",
       "see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of\n",
       "pleasure from them in any other way.  They attempted, therefore,\n",
       "likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not\n",
       "likely to be good.  But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage\n",
       "should be sent for them and they must come.  Lady Middleton too, though\n",
       "she did not press their mother, pressed them.  Mrs. Jennings and Mrs.\n",

       "\n",

       "day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as\n",
       "good humoured and merry as before.  She took them all most\n",

       "about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think\n",
       "he is extremely handsome.  We do not live a great way from him in the\n",
       "country, you know.  Not above ten miles, I dare say.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid\n",

       "thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.\n",
       "Palmer.  The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her\n",
       "husband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was\n",
       "highly diverted.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Palmer is so droll!\" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor.  \"He is\n",
       "always out of humour.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit\n",
       "for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he\n",
       "wished to appear.  His temper might perhaps be a little soured by\n",
       "finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable\n",
       "bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly\n",
       "woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any\n",
       "sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of\n",
       "distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of\n",
       "every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him.  It was\n",
       "the desire of appearing superior to other people.  The motive was too\n",
       "common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by\n",
       "establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach\n",
       "any one to him except his wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,\" said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, \"I have\n",

       "\n",
       "\"There now,\"--said his lady, \"you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you\n",

       "\n",
       "\"But indeed you must and shall come.  I am sure you will like it of all\n",
       "things.  The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.\n",
       "You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay\n",
       "now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing\n",
       "against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I\n",
       "never saw before, it is quite charming!  But, poor fellow! it is very\n",
       "fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the\n",
       "hardship of such an obligation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How charming it will be,\" said Charlotte, \"when he is in\n",
       "Parliament!--won't it? How I shall laugh!  It will be so ridiculous to\n",
       "see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do you know, he\n",
       "says, he will never frank for me?  He declares he won't.  Don't you,\n",
       "Mr. Palmer?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He cannot bear writing, you know,\" she continued--\"he says it is quite\n",
       "shocking.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said he, \"I never said any thing so irrational.  Don't palm all\n",
       "your abuses of languages upon me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There now; you see how droll he is.  This is always the way with him!\n",
       "Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he\n",
       "comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,\n",
       "by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"he seems very agreeable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well--I am so glad you do.  I thought you would, he is so pleasant;\n",
       "and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can\n",
       "tell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don't\n",
       "come to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object to it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the\n",
       "subject, put a stop to her entreaties.  She thought it probable that as\n",
       "they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some\n",
       "more particular account of Willoughby's general character, than could\n",
       "be gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him; and she\n",
       "was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as\n",
       "might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne.  She began by\n",
       "inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether\n",
       "they were intimately acquainted with him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well,\" replied Mrs. Palmer;--\"Not\n",

       "Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was\n",
       "at Allenham.  Mama saw him here once before;--but I was with my uncle\n",
       "at Weymouth.  However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of\n",
       "him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we\n",
       "should never have been in the country together.  He is very little at\n",
       "Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr.\n",
       "Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and\n",
       "besides it is such a way off.  I know why you inquire about him, very\n",
       "well; your sister is to marry him.  I am monstrous glad of it, for then\n",
       "I shall have her for a neighbour you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"you know much more of the matter than\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks\n",

       "\n",
       "\"My dear Mrs. Palmer!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in\n",
       "Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You surprise me very much.  Colonel Brandon tell you of it!  Surely\n",
       "you must be mistaken.  To give such intelligence to a person who could\n",
       "not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should\n",
       "expect Colonel Brandon to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how\n",
       "it happened.  When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and\n",
       "so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and\n",
       "another, and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family come to\n",
       "Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty,\n",
       "and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe\n",
       "Magna.  Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been\n",
       "in Devonshire so lately.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what did the Colonel say?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh--he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so\n",
       "from that moment I set it down as certain.  It will be quite\n",
       "delightful, I declare!  When is it to take place?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but\n",
       "say fine things of you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am flattered by his commendation.  He seems an excellent man; and I\n",
       "think him uncommonly pleasing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should\n",
       "be so grave and so dull.  Mamma says HE was in love with your sister\n",
       "too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly\n",
       "ever falls in love with any body.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?\" said\n",
       "Elinor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are\n",
       "acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all\n",
       "think him extremely agreeable I assure you.  Nobody is more liked than\n",
       "Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister.  She\n",
       "is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he\n",
       "is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and\n",
       "agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her.  However, I don't\n",
       "think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think\n",
       "you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,\n",
       "though we could not get him to own it last night.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material;\n",

       "\"he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could.  Sir John\n",
       "and Lady Middleton wished it very much.  But mama did not think the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your mother\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have\n",

       "The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at\n",
       "Barton were again left to entertain each other.  But this did not last\n",
       "long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had\n",
       "hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at\n",
       "Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange\n",
       "unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir\n",
       "John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society,\n",
       "procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,\n",
       "whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her\n",
       "relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to\n",
       "the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over.\n",
       "Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an\n",
       "invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the\n",
       "return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a\n",
       "visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\n",
       "elegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for\n",
       "the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\n",
       "nothing at all.  Their being her relations too made it so much the\n",
       "worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore\n",
       "unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about\n",
       "their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put\n",
       "up with one another.  As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\n",
       "their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with\n",
       "all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely\n",
       "giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times\n",
       "every day.\n",
       "\n",
       "The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or\n",
       "unfashionable.  Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil,\n",
       "they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture,\n",
       "and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady\n",
       "Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had\n",
       "been an hour at the Park.  She declared them to be very agreeable girls\n",
       "indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration.  Sir John's\n",
       "confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he\n",
       "set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss\n",
       "Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\n",
       "in the world.  From such commendation as this, however, there was not\n",
       "much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the\n",
       "world were to be met with in every part of England, under every\n",
       "possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding.  Sir John\n",
       "wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his\n",
       "guests.  Benevolent, philanthropic man!  It was painful to him even to\n",
       "keep a third cousin to himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do come now,\" said he--\"pray come--you must come--I declare you shall\n",
       "come--You can't think how you will like them.  Lucy is monstrous\n",
       "pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable!  The children are all\n",
       "hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance.  And they\n",
       "both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that\n",
       "you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them\n",
       "it is all very true, and a great deal more.  You will be delighted with\n",
       "them I am sure.  They have brought the whole coach full of playthings\n",
       "for the children.  How can you be so cross as not to come?  Why they\n",
       "are your cousins, you know, after a fashion.  YOU are my cousins, and\n",
       "they are my wife's, so you must be related.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But Sir John could not prevail.  He could only obtain a promise of\n",
       "their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in\n",
       "amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their\n",
       "attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the\n",
       "Miss Steeles to them.\n",
       "\n",
       "When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to\n",
       "these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the\n",
       "eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible\n",
       "face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or\n",
       "three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features\n",
       "were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air,\n",
       "which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction\n",
       "to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon\n",
       "allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what\n",
       "constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable\n",
       "to Lady Middleton.  With her children they were in continual raptures,\n",
       "extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their\n",
       "whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate\n",
       "demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of\n",
       "whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing,\n",
       "or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her\n",
       "appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight.\n",
       "Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond\n",
       "mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most\n",
       "rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands\n",
       "are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive\n",
       "affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were\n",
       "viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or\n",
       "distrust.  She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent\n",
       "encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted.\n",
       "She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their\n",
       "work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt\n",
       "no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested no other\n",
       "surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by,\n",
       "without claiming a share in what was passing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"John is in such spirits today!\" said she, on his taking Miss Steeles's\n",
       "pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--\"He is full of\n",
       "monkey tricks.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of the\n",
       "same lady's fingers, she fondly observed, \"How playful William is!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And here is my sweet little Annamaria,\" she added, tenderly caressing\n",
       "a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last\n",
       "two minutes; \"And she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there\n",
       "such a quiet little thing!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's\n",
       "head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this\n",
       "pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone\n",
       "by any creature professedly noisy.  The mother's consternation was\n",
       "excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and\n",
       "every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which\n",
       "affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little\n",
       "sufferer.  She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, her\n",
       "wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was\n",
       "on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by\n",
       "the other.  With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to\n",
       "cease crying.  She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two\n",
       "brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were\n",
       "ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of\n",
       "similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been\n",
       "successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly\n",
       "proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of\n",
       "screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that\n",
       "it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore\n",
       "in her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys\n",
       "chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay\n",
       "behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room\n",
       "had not known for many hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor little creatures!\" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone.\n",
       "\"It might have been a very sad accident.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yet I hardly know how,\" cried Marianne, \"unless it had been under\n",
       "totally different circumstances.  But this is the usual way of\n",
       "heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!\" said Lucy Steele.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not\n",
       "feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole\n",
       "task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell.  She did\n",
       "her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more\n",
       "warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And Sir John too,\" cried the elder sister, \"what a charming man he is!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just,\n",
       "came in without any eclat.  She merely observed that he was perfectly\n",
       "good humoured and friendly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what a charming little family they have!  I never saw such fine\n",
       "children in my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already, and\n",
       "indeed I am always distractedly fond of children.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should guess so,\" said Elinor, with a smile, \"from what I have\n",
       "witnessed this morning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have a notion,\" said Lucy, \"you think the little Middletons rather\n",
       "too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is\n",
       "so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children\n",
       "full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and\n",
       "quiet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I confess,\" replied Elinor, \"that while I am at Barton Park, I never\n",
       "think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss\n",
       "Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now\n",
       "said rather abruptly, \"And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?\n",
       "I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of\n",
       "the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?\" added Miss Steele.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have heard Sir John admire it excessively,\" said Lucy, who seemed\n",
       "to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think every one MUST admire it,\" replied Elinor, \"who ever saw the\n",
       "place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its\n",
       "beauties as we do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And had you a great many smart beaux there?  I suppose you have not so\n",
       "many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast\n",
       "addition always.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But why should you think,\" said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister,\n",
       "\"that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't.  I'm\n",
       "sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could\n",
       "I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only\n",
       "afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not\n",
       "so many as they used to have.  But perhaps you young ladies may not\n",
       "care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them.\n",
       "For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress\n",
       "smart and behave civil.  But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty.\n",
       "Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a\n",
       "beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of\n",
       "a morning, he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite\n",
       "a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" replied Elinor, \"I cannot tell you, for I do not\n",
       "perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word.  But this I can say, that\n",
       "if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is\n",
       "not the smallest alteration in him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men's being beaux--they have\n",
       "something else to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Lord! Anne,\" cried her sister, \"you can talk of nothing but\n",
       "beaux;--you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else.\"\n",
       "And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and the\n",
       "furniture.\n",
       "\n",
       "This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough.  The vulgar freedom and\n",
       "folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not\n",
       "blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want\n",
       "of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish\n",
       "of knowing them better.\n",
       "\n",
       "Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided with\n",
       "admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his\n",
       "relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair\n",
       "cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant,\n",
       "accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom\n",
       "they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be\n",
       "better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable\n",
       "lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles,\n",
       "their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of\n",
       "intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two\n",
       "together in the same room almost every day.  Sir John could do no more;\n",
       "but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in\n",
       "his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their\n",
       "meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established\n",
       "friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their\n",
       "unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew\n",
       "or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate\n",
       "particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the\n",
       "eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as\n",
       "to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.\n",

       "assertion attended it.  She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,\n",
       "unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though\n",
       "her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy; \"for to be sure you could\n",

       "Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt\n",
       "the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really\n",

       "Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you,\n",
       "because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your\n",

       "\n",
       "Elinor for a few moments remained silent.  Her astonishment at what she\n",
       "heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself\n",
       "to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner,\n",
       "which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- \"May I ask\n",

       "increased with her increase of emotion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near\n",
       "Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me\n",
       "was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was\n",
       "formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he\n",
       "was almost always with us afterwards.  I was very unwilling to enter\n",
       "into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of\n",
       "his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so\n",
       "prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well\n",
       "as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible\n",
       "he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after\n",
       "a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's\n",
       "honour and love, and her companion's falsehood--\"Engaged to Mr. Edward\n",
       "Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,\n",
       "that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake\n",
       "of person or name.  We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We can mean no other,\" cried Lucy, smiling.  \"Mr. Edward Ferrars, the\n",
       "eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your\n",
       "sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow\n",
       "that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who\n",
       "all my happiness depends.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is strange,\" replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, \"that I\n",
       "should never have heard him even mention your name.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange.  Our first care has\n",
       "been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me, or my family,\n",
       "and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name\n",
       "to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister's\n",
       "suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her self-command did not\n",
       "sink with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Four years you have been engaged,\" said she with a firm voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait.  Poor\n",
       "Edward!  It puts him quite out of heart.\" Then taking a small miniature\n",
       "from her pocket, she added, \"To prevent the possibility of mistake, be\n",
       "so good as to look at this face.  It does not do him justice, to be\n",
       "sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was\n",
       "drew for.--I have had it above these three years.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the\n",
       "painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or\n",
       "her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she\n",
       "could have none of its being Edward's face.  She returned it almost\n",
       "instantly, acknowledging the likeness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have never been able,\" continued Lucy, \"to give him my picture in\n",
       "return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so\n",
       "anxious to get it!  But I am determined to set for it the very first\n",
       "opportunity.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are quite in the right,\" replied Elinor calmly.  They then\n",
       "proceeded a few paces in silence.  Lucy spoke first.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully\n",
       "keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to\n",
       "us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,\n",
       "I dare say.  I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\n",
       "proud woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor; \"but you do me\n",
       "no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.  Your\n",
       "secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so\n",
       "unnecessary a communication.  You must at least have felt that my being\n",
       "acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover\n",
       "something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest\n",
       "part of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered no\n",
       "change.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,\"\n",
       "said she, \"in telling you all this.  I have not known you long to be\n",
       "sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by\n",
       "description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as\n",
       "if you was an old acquaintance.  Besides in the present case, I really\n",
       "thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular\n",
       "inquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have\n",
       "not a creature whose advice I can ask.  Anne is the only person that\n",
       "knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a\n",
       "great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her\n",
       "betraying me.  She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must\n",
       "perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world\n",
       "t'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she\n",
       "should out with it all.  You can't think how much I go through in my\n",
       "mind from it altogether.  I only wonder that I am alive after what I\n",
       "have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years.  Every thing in\n",
       "such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly\n",
       "meet above twice a-year.  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite\n",
       "broke.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very\n",
       "compassionate.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sometimes.\" continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, \"I think whether it\n",
       "would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.\"  As\n",
       "she said this, she looked directly at her companion.  \"But then at\n",
       "other times I have not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear the\n",
       "thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such\n",
       "a thing would do.  And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I\n",
       "don't think I could be equal to it.  What would you advise me to do in\n",
       "such a case, Miss Dashwood?  What would you do yourself?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pardon me,\" replied Elinor, startled by the question; \"but I can give\n",
       "you no advice under such circumstances.  Your own judgment must direct\n",
       "you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To be sure,\" continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both\n",
       "sides, \"his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor\n",
       "Edward is so cast down by it!  Did you not think him dreadful\n",
       "low-spirited when he was at Barton?  He was so miserable when he left\n",
       "us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him\n",
       "quite ill.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us.  Did you think he\n",
       "came directly from town?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh\n",
       "circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; \"I remember he told us, that\n",
       "he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.\" She\n",
       "remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing\n",
       "farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to\n",
       "their names.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did not you think him sadly out of spirits?\" repeated Lucy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the\n",
       "matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than\n",
       "a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I\n",
       "am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched\n",
       "spirits.  I heard from him just before I left Exeter;\" taking a letter\n",
       "from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor.  \"You\n",
       "know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not\n",
       "written so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, for he had just\n",
       "filled the sheet to me as full as possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer.  This\n",
       "picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been\n",
       "accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a\n",
       "correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a\n",
       "positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few\n",
       "moments, she was almost overcome--her heart sunk within her, and she\n",
       "could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she\n",
       "struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that\n",
       "her success was speedy, and for the time complete.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Writing to each other,\" said Lucy, returning the letter into her\n",
       "pocket, \"is the only comfort we have in such long separations.  Yes, I\n",
       "have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even\n",
       "THAT.  If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy.  I gave him\n",
       "a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and\n",
       "that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture.\n",

       "intelligence must have had some weight.  But indeed, while Elinor\n",
       "remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by\n",
       "Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it\n",

       "enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most\n",
       "easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at\n",
       "least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at\n",

       "Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for\n",
       "a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse.  They met for\n",

       "or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.\n",
       "\n",

       "the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they\n",
       "would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to\n",
       "attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone,\n",
       "except her mother and the two Miss Steeles.  Elinor, who foresaw a\n",
       "fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this\n",
       "was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\n",
       "and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united\n",
       "them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the\n",
       "invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally\n",
       "compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their\n",
       "parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her\n",

       "\n",
       "The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from\n",
       "the frightful solitude which had threatened her.  The insipidity of the\n",
       "meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one\n",
       "novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting\n",
       "than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and\n",
       "drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while\n",
       "they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of\n",
       "engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it.  They quitted it only with the\n",
       "removal of the tea-things.  The card-table was then placed, and Elinor\n",
       "began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of\n",
       "finding time for conversation at the park.  They all rose up in\n",
       "preparation for a round game.\n",
       "\n",

       "your eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  And we will make the dear\n",
       "little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I\n",
       "hope she will not much mind it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,\n",
       "\"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting\n",
       "to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have\n",
       "been at my filigree already.  I would not disappoint the little angel\n",
       "for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am\n",
       "resolved to finish the basket after supper.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--will you ring the\n",
       "bell for some working candles?  My poor little girl would be sadly\n",
       "disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for\n",
       "though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon\n",
       "having it done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an\n",
       "alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no\n",
       "greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others.  No one made\n",
       "any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms\n",
       "of general civility, exclaimed, \"Your Ladyship will have the goodness\n",
       "to excuse ME--you know I detest cards.  I shall go to the piano-forte;\n",
       "I have not touched it since it was tuned.\"  And without farther\n",
       "ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made\n",
       "so rude a speech.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am,\"\n",
       "said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; \"and I do not\n",
       "much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever\n",
       "heard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The remaining five were now to draw their cards.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps,\" continued Elinor, \"if I should happen to cut out, I may be\n",
       "of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and\n",
       "there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be\n",
       "impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening.  I\n",
       "should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,\" cried Lucy,\n",
       "\"for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;\n",
       "and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after\n",
       "all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,\" said Miss Steele-- \"Dear little\n",
       "soul, how I do love her!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are very kind,\" said Lady Middleton to Elinor; \"and as you really\n",
       "like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till\n",
       "another rubber, or will you take your chance now?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a\n",
       "little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to\n",
       "practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same\n",
       "time.  Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair\n",
       "rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the\n",
       "utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.  The pianoforte at\n",
       "which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had\n",
       "by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,\n",
       "was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might\n",
       "safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting\n",

       "\n",
       "In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with,\n",
       "if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its\n",
       "subject.  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you,\" cried Lucy warmly, \"for breaking the ice; you have set my\n",

       "you by what I told you that Monday.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Offended me! How could you suppose so? Believe me,\" and Elinor spoke\n",
       "it with the truest sincerity, \"nothing could be farther from my\n",
       "intention than to give you such an idea.  Could you have a motive for\n",
       "the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "manner that made me quite uncomfortable.  I felt sure that you was\n",
       "angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for\n",
       "having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs.  But I am\n",
       "very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not\n",
       "blame me.  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my\n",
       "heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of\n",
       "my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am\n",
       "sure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you,\n",
       "to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall\n",
       "never have reason to repent it.  Your case is a very unfortunate one;\n",
       "you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have\n",
       "need of all your mutual affection to support you under them.  Mr.\n",
       "Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect\n",
       "of more without a sigh.  I have been always used to a very small\n",
       "income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too\n",
       "well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his\n",
       "mother might give him if he married to please her.  We must wait, it\n",
       "may be for many years.  With almost every other man in the world, it\n",
       "would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancy\n",
       "nothing can deprive me of I know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly\n",

       "\"Edward's love for me,\" said Lucy, \"has been pretty well put to the\n",

       "it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt\n",
       "it now.  I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarm\n",

       "whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the\n",

       "very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions\n",
       "were; in all probability he was already in town.  Marianne's eagerness\n",
       "to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was\n",
       "resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character\n",
       "which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her,\n",
       "but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such\n",
       "zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant,\n",
       "before many meetings had taken place.  Should the result of her\n",
       "observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open\n",
       "the eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be\n",
       "of a different nature--she must then learn to avoid every selfish\n",
       "comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction\n",
       "in the happiness of Marianne.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they\n",
       "travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and\n",
       "companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be.  She sat in\n",
       "silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely\n",
       "ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty\n",
       "within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively\n",
       "addressed to her sister.  To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor\n",
       "took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had\n",
       "assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,\n",
       "talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she\n",
       "could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all\n",
       "possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and\n",
       "enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their\n",
       "own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring\n",
       "salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets.  They reached town by\n",
       "three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,\n",
       "from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury\n",
       "of a good fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies\n",
       "were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment.  It\n",
       "had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung a\n",
       "landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having\n",
       "spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.\n",
       "\n",
       "As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their\n",
       "arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her\n",
       "mother, and sat down for that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne did\n",
       "the same.  \"I am writing home, Marianne,\" said Elinor; \"had not you\n",
       "better defer your letter for a day or two?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am NOT going to write to my mother,\" replied Marianne, hastily, and\n",
       "as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry.  Elinor said no more; it\n",
       "immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and\n",
       "the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however\n",
       "mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be\n",
       "engaged.  This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her\n",
       "pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity.\n",
       "Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no\n",
       "more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with\n",
       "eager rapidity.  Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\n",
       "direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\n",
       "bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed\n",
       "for her to the two-penny post.  This decided the matter at once.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\n",
       "which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this\n",
       "agitation increased as the evening drew on.  She could scarcely eat any\n",
       "dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed\n",
       "anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much\n",
       "engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing.  The tea\n",
       "things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more\n",
       "than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly\n",
       "heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor\n",
       "felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne,\n",
       "starting up, moved towards the door.  Every thing was silent; this\n",
       "could not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few\n",
       "steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned\n",
       "into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\n",
       "him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that\n",
       "instant she could not help exclaiming, \"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby,\n",
       "indeed it is!\" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms,\n",
       "when Colonel Brandon appeared.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately\n",
       "left the room.  Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her\n",
       "regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt\n",
       "particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive\n",
       "that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing\n",
       "him.  She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even\n",
       "observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and\n",
       "concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded\n",
       "towards herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is your sister ill?\" said he.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of\n",
       "head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which\n",
       "she could decently attribute her sister's behaviour.\n",
       "\n",
       "He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\n",
       "himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\n",
       "his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about\n",
       "their journey, and the friends they had left behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\n",
       "they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts\n",
       "of both engaged elsewhere.  Elinor wished very much to ask whether\n",
       "Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by\n",
       "any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something,\n",
       "she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last.\n",
       "\"Yes,\" he replied, with some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; I have\n",
       "been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in\n",
       "my power to return to Barton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to\n",
       "her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with\n",
       "the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she\n",
       "was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the\n",
       "subject than she had ever felt.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  \"Oh! Colonel,\" said she, with her usual\n",
       "noisy cheerfulness, \"I am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not\n",
       "come before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a\n",
       "little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been\n",
       "at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do\n",
       "after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to\n",
       "settle with-- Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner!\n",
       "But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town\n",
       "today?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have been\n",
       "dining.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house?  How does\n",
       "Charlotte do?  I warrant you she is a fine size by this time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,\n",
       "that you will certainly see her to-morrow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much.  Well, Colonel, I have brought two\n",
       "young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now,\n",
       "but there is another somewhere.  Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which\n",
       "you will not be sorry to hear.  I do not know what you and Mr.\n",
       "Willoughby will do between you about her.  Ay, it is a fine thing to be\n",
       "young and handsome.  Well! I was young once, but I never was very\n",
       "handsome--worse luck for me.  However, I got a very good husband, and I\n",
       "don't know what the greatest beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! he has\n",
       "been dead these eight years and better.  But Colonel, where have you\n",
       "been to since we parted?  And how does your business go on?  Come,\n",
       "come, let's have no secrets among friends.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but\n",
       "without satisfying her in any.  Elinor now began to make the tea, and\n",
       "Marianne was obliged to appear again.\n",
       "\n",
       "After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent\n",
       "than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to\n",
       "stay long.  No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were\n",
       "unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.\n",
       "The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the\n",
       "expectation of what was to happen that day.  They had not long finished\n",
       "their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and\n",
       "in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see\n",
       "them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure\n",
       "from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.  So surprised at\n",
       "their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all\n",
       "along; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after having\n",
       "declined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven\n",
       "them if they had not come!\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,\" said she; \"What do you think\n",
       "he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma?  I forget what it was\n",
       "now, but it was something so droll!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat,\n",
       "or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their\n",

       "accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to\n",
       "which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise\n",
       "some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at\n",
       "first was induced to go likewise.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch.  In Bond\n",
       "Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in\n",
       "constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind\n",
       "was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all\n",
       "that interested and occupied the others.  Restless and dissatisfied\n",
       "every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article\n",
       "of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received\n",
       "no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and\n",
       "could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.\n",
       "Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;\n",
       "who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her\n",
       "time in rapture and indecision.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had\n",
       "they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when\n",
       "Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful\n",
       "countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.\n",
       "\n",

       "negative.  \"Are you quite sure of it?\" she replied.  \"Are you certain\n",
       "that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The man replied that none had.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How very odd!\" said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she\n",
       "turned away to the window.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How odd, indeed!\" repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister\n",
       "with uneasiness.  \"If she had not known him to be in town she would not\n",
       "have written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna;\n",
       "and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write!\n",
       "Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement\n",
       "between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in\n",
       "so doubtful, so mysterious a manner!  I long to inquire; and how will\n",
       "MY interference be borne.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued\n",

       "Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate\n",

       "them.  The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening\n",
       "engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\n",
       "for the others.  Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she\n",
       "would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her\n",
       "own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure\n",
       "to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of\n",
       "expectation and the pain of disappointment.  She sometimes endeavoured\n",
       "for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she\n",
       "returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and\n",
       "forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That is true,\" cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the\n",

       "truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough\n",
       "contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could\n",
       "not be very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne was in spirits; happy\n",

       "entered it.  He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\n",
       "satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in\n",
       "particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word.\n",
       "Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her\n",

       "once before, beginning with the observation of \"your sister looks\n",
       "unwell to-day,\" or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared\n",
       "on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something\n",
       "particular about her.  After a pause of several minutes, their silence\n",
       "was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was\n",

       "quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne\n",

       "that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her\n",

       "No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very\n",
       "thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I\n",
       "certainly will.  For my part, I think the less that is said about such\n",

       "\n",

       "of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for\n",
       "the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the\n",
       "public conversation.  I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby--he has\n",

       "\n",

       "with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be\n",

       "how he'll chuckle over this news!  I hope he will come tonight.  It\n",
       "will be all to one a better match for your sister.  Two thousand a year\n",
       "without debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I\n",
       "had forgot her; but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then\n",
       "what does it signify?  Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you;\n",
       "exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and\n",
       "conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered\n",
       "with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in\n",
       "one corner!  Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were\n",
       "there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a\n",
       "very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;\n",
       "and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile\n",
       "from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit\n",
       "up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages\n",
       "that pass along.  Oh! 'tis a nice place!  A butcher hard by in the\n",
       "village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw.  To my fancy,\n",
       "a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to\n",
       "send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than\n",
       "your mother.  Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can.\n",
       "One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down.  If we CAN but\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am,\" said Elinor, \"we shall do very well\n",
       "with or without Colonel Brandon.\" And then rising, she went away to\n",
       "join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room,\n",
       "leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,\n",

       "from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first\n",
       "refused to do.  Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion,\n",
       "however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her\n",
       "aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet\n",
       "rest before she left her.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear,\" said she, entering, \"I have just recollected that I have\n",
       "some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was\n",
       "tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister.  My poor\n",
       "husband! how fond he was of it!  Whenever he had a touch of his old\n",
       "colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the\n",
       "world.  Do take it to your sister.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dear Ma'am,\" replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the\n",
       "complaints for which it was recommended, \"how good you are!  But I have\n",
       "just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think\n",
       "nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me\n",
       "leave, I will drink the wine myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes\n",
       "earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she\n",
       "swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a\n",
       "colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing\n",
       "powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself\n",
       "as on her sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner\n",
       "of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that\n",
       "he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he\n",
       "was already aware of what occasioned her absence.  Mrs. Jennings was\n",
       "not struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked\n",
       "across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered--\n",
       "\"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see.  He knows nothing of it;\n",
       "do tell him, my dear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to her's, and, with a look\n",
       "which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her\n",
       "sister.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Marianne is not well,\" said she.  \"She has been indisposed all day,\n",
       "and we have persuaded her to go to bed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps, then,\" he hesitatingly replied, \"what I heard this morning\n",

       "first.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What did you hear?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think--in short, that a man,\n",
       "whom I KNEW to be engaged--but how shall I tell you?  If you know it\n",
       "already, as surely you must, I may be spared.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mean,\" answered Elinor, with forced calmness, \"Mr. Willoughby's\n",
       "marriage with Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO know it all.  This seems to have\n",
       "been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded\n",

       "\n",
       "\"In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business.  Two ladies\n",

       "Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\n",
       "Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as\n",
       "unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every\n",
       "consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him.  At one moment she\n",
       "was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at\n",
       "another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third\n",
       "could resist it with energy.  In one thing, however, she was uniform,\n",
       "when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the\n",
       "presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to\n",
       "endure it.  Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs.\n",
       "Jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no, no, it cannot be,\" she cried; \"she cannot feel.  Her kindness\n",

       "is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her\n",

       "refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her\n",
       "on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished\n",

       "from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she\n",

       "instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room\n",
       "to inforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances\n",
       "of his letter.  The work of one moment was destroyed by the next.  The\n",

       "and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an\n",

       "relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by\n",
       "Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards\n",
       "them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection\n",

       "Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne\n",
       "to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of\n",

       "the rest of the morning.  Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the\n",
       "pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's\n",

       "sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat\n",
       "her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the\n",
       "drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table\n",
       "where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over\n",

       "over its effect on her mother.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when\n",

       "seventeen she was lost to me for ever.  She was married--married\n",
       "against her inclination to my brother.  Her fortune was large, and our\n",
       "family estate much encumbered.  And this, I fear, is all that can be\n",

       "experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though\n",
       "she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate!  I have\n",
       "never told you how this was brought on.  We were within a few hours of\n",
       "eloping together for Scotland.  The treachery, or the folly, of my\n",
       "cousin's maid betrayed us.  I was banished to the house of a relation\n",
       "far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement,\n",
       "till my father's point was gained.  I had depended on her fortitude too\n",
       "far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, so\n",
       "young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at\n",
       "least I should not have now to lament it.  This however was not the\n",
       "case.  My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what\n",

       "The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so\n",
       "inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  She resigned\n",

       "been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the\n",
       "remembrance of me occasioned.  But can we wonder that, with such a\n",

       "happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose\n",
       "had procured my exchange.  The shock which her marriage had given me,\"\n",
       "he continued, in a voice of great agitation, \"was of trifling\n",
       "weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years\n",

       "distress, could not speak.  He saw her concern, and coming to her, took\n",
       "her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.  A few\n",

       "not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to\n",
       "fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of\n",
       "sin.  Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor\n",
       "sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my\n",
       "brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months\n",
       "before to another person.  He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it,\n",
       "that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to\n",
       "dispose of it for some immediate relief.  At last, however, and after I\n",
       "had been six months in England, I DID find her.  Regard for a former\n",
       "servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to\n",

       "there, the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate\n",
       "sister.  So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering of every\n",
       "kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before\n",
       "me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom\n",
       "I had once doted.  What I endured in so beholding her--but I have no\n",
       "right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I have\n",
       "pained you too much already.  That she was, to all appearance, in the\n",
       "last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was my\n",
       "greatest comfort.  Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time\n",
       "for a better preparation for death; and that was given.  I saw her\n",
       "placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited\n",
       "her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her\n",
       "last moments.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in\n",

       "little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then\n",
       "about three years old.  She loved the child, and had always kept it\n",

       "have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her\n",
       "education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I\n",
       "had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at\n",

       "brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the\n",
       "possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford.  I\n",
       "called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in\n",
       "general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her.  It is now\n",
       "three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I\n",
       "removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very\n",
       "respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four\n",
       "or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I\n",
       "had every reason to be pleased with her situation.  But last February,\n",
       "almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared.  I had allowed\n",
       "her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire,\n",
       "to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her\n",
       "father there for his health.  I knew him to be a very good sort of man,\n",
       "and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, with\n",
       "a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would\n",
       "give no clue, though she certainly knew all.  He, her father, a\n",
       "well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe,\n",
       "give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house,\n",
       "while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance\n",
       "they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was\n",
       "convinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the\n",
       "business.  In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all\n",

       "Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party\n",
       "to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,\n",
       "which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,\n",
       "and which I believe gave offence to some.  Little did Mr. Willoughby\n",
       "imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in\n",
       "breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom\n",
       "he had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it have\n",
       "availed?  Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of\n",
       "your sister?  No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel\n",
       "for another would do.  He had left the girl whose youth and innocence\n",
       "he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no\n",
       "creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address!  He had\n",
       "left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor\n",

       "being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt\n",

       "I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when\n",
       "it WAS known.  My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but\n",
       "now you will comprehend it.  To suffer you all to be so deceived; to\n",
       "see your sister--but what could I do?  I had no hope of interfering\n",
       "with success; and sometimes I thought your sister's influence might yet\n",
       "reclaim him.  But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what\n",

       "considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and\n",
       "pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as\n",
       "strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which\n",
       "must attend her through life.  Surely this comparison must have its use\n",
       "with her.  She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing.  They\n",
       "proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace.  On the\n",
       "contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them.\n",
       "Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it,\n",
       "must strengthen every attachment.  Use your own discretion, however, in\n",
       "communicating to her what I have told you.  You must know best what\n",
       "will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed\n",
       "it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have\n",

       "Elinor's.  Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other,\n",
       "arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her\n",
       "anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken.  A very little\n",

       "undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his\n",
       "friends may all advise him against it.  But some of those little\n",
       "attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix\n",
       "him, in spite of himself.  And there can be no reason why you should\n",
       "not try for him.  It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on\n",
       "your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is\n",
       "quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have\n",
       "too much sense not to see all that.  Colonel Brandon must be the man;\n",
       "and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with\n",
       "you and your family.  It is a match that must give universal\n",
       "satisfaction.  In short, it is a kind of thing that\"--lowering his\n",
       "voice to an important whisper--\"will be exceedingly welcome to ALL\n",

       "say--your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny\n",
       "particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure\n",
       "you.  And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am\n",

       "\n",
       "Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It would be something remarkable, now,\" he continued, \"something\n",

       "same time.  And yet it is not very unlikely.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,\" said Elinor, with resolution, \"going to be\n",
       "married?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation.\n",
       "He has a most excellent mother.  Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost\n",
       "liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if\n",
       "the match takes place.  The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter\n",
       "of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds.  A very desirable\n",
       "connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in\n",
       "time.  A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to\n",
       "make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit.  To give you\n",
       "another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we came\n",
       "to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,\n",
       "she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred\n",
       "pounds.  And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great\n",
       "expense while we are here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;\n",
       "but your income is a large one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose.  I do not mean to\n",
       "complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will\n",
       "in time be better.  The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on,\n",
       "is a most serious drain.  And then I have made a little purchase within\n",
       "this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where\n",
       "old Gibson used to live.  The land was so very desirable for me in\n",
       "every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it\n",
       "my duty to buy it.  I could not have answered it to my conscience to\n",
       "let it fall into any other hands.  A man must pay for his convenience;\n",
       "and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, I hope not that.  I might have sold it again, the next day, for\n",
       "more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have\n",
       "been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,\n",
       "that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's\n",
       "hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor could only smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to\n",
       "Norland.  Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the\n",
       "Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)\n",
       "to your mother.  Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an\n",
       "undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in\n",
       "consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of\n",
       "linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away.  You may\n",
       "guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being\n",
       "rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" said Elinor; \"and assisted by her liberality, I hope you\n",
       "may yet live to be in easy circumstances.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Another year or two may do much towards it,\" he gravely replied; \"but\n",
       "however there is still a great deal to be done.  There is not a stone\n",
       "laid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the plan of the\n",
       "flower-garden marked out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where is the green-house to be?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon the knoll behind the house.  The old walnut trees are all come\n",
       "down to make room for it.  It will be a very fine object from many\n",
       "parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before\n",
       "it, and be exceedingly pretty.  We have cleared away all the old thorns\n",
       "that grew in patches over the brow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very\n",
       "thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the\n",
       "necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in his\n",
       "next visit at Gray's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began\n",
       "to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style of\n",
       "living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance\n",
       "that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may\n",
       "prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a\n",
       "vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a\n",
       "regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be\n",
       "forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her\n",
       "jointure, which will descend to her children.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income.  Few\n",
       "people of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she saves, she\n",
       "will be able to dispose of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her\n",
       "daughters, than to us?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I\n",
       "cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther.\n",
       "Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and\n",
       "treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on\n",
       "her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not\n",
       "disregard.  Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can\n",
       "hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But she raises none in those most concerned.  Indeed, brother, your\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Why, to be sure,\" said he, seeming to recollect himself, \"people have\n",
       "little, have very little in their power.  But, my dear Elinor, what is\n",
       "the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell, has lost her colour,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I am sorry for that.  At her time of life, any thing of an illness\n",
       "destroys the bloom for ever!  Her's has been a very short one!  She was\n",
       "as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to\n",
       "attract the man.  There was something in her style of beauty, to please\n",
       "them particularly.  I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry\n",
       "sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of\n",
       "YOU, but so it happened to strike her.  She will be mistaken, however.\n",
       "I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five\n",
       "or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if\n",
       "YOU do not do better.  Dorsetshire!  I know very little of Dorsetshire;\n",

       "resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the\n",

       "anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from\n",

       "his fear of her not finding London agree with her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, don't think of me!\" she replied with spirited earnestness, though\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Not at all.  I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that\n",
       "conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street.  And I really believe\n",
       "he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous\n",
       "in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make\n",
       "against his interest or pleasure.  He is the most fearful of giving\n",
       "pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,\n",
       "of any body I ever saw.  Edward, it is so, and I will say it.  What!\n",
       "are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you must be no friend of\n",
       "mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to\n",

       "The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened\n",
       "to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her\n",

       "would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted\n",
       "two hours, soon afterwards went away.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Why so?--we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known\n",

       "well as ourselves.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the\n",
       "world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a\n",
       "son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least\n",
       "to all those intimate connections who knew it before.\n",
       "\n",
       "This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a\n",
       "temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a\n",
       "like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to\n",
       "be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning\n",
       "as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the\n",
       "evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the\n",
       "Middletons, spent the whole of every day, in every day in Conduit\n",
       "Street.  For their own comfort they would much rather have remained, at\n",
       "least all the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing\n",
       "to be urged against the wishes of everybody.  Their hours were\n",
       "therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom\n",
       "their company, in fact was as little valued, as it was professedly\n",
       "sought.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and\n",
       "by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on\n",
       "THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize.\n",
       "Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to\n",
       "Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all.  Because they\n",
       "neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them\n",
       "good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them\n",
       "satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical;\n",
       "but THAT did not signify.  It was censure in common use, and easily\n",
       "given.\n",
       "\n",
       "Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy.  It checked the\n",
       "idleness of one, and the business of the other.  Lady Middleton was\n",
       "ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was\n",
       "proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would\n",
       "despise her for offering.  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the\n",
       "three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to\n",
       "it entirely.  Would either of them only have given her a full and\n",
       "minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby,\n",
       "she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the\n",
       "best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned.\n",
       "But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out\n",
       "expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt\n",
       "a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was\n",
       "produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in\n",
       "the latter.  An effort even yet lighter might have made her their\n",

       "of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not\n",

       "must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance.  In the present\n",

       "Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she\n",
       "immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this\n",
       "misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of\n",
       "invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small\n",
       "musical party at her house.  The consequence of which was, that Mrs.\n",
       "John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great\n",

       "when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be\n",
       "wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from\n",
       "them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of\n",
       "going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to\n",
       "her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically\n",
       "for every evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest\n",

       "moment, where it was to take her.\n",

       "toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of\n",
       "their being together, when it was finished.  Nothing escaped HER minute\n",
       "observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked every\n",
       "thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of\n",
       "Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether\n",
       "with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes\n",
       "of finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week,\n",
       "and how much she had every year to spend upon herself.  The\n",
       "impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally\n",
       "concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was\n",
       "considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after\n",
       "undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the\n",
       "colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost\n",
       "sure of being told that upon \"her word she looked vastly smart, and she\n",
       "dared to say she would make a great many conquests.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.\n",
       "\n",
       "The events of this evening were not very remarkable.  The party, like\n",
       "other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real\n",
       "taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;\n",
       "and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,\n",

       "suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and\n",
       "violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the\n",

       "\n",
       "He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow\n",
       "which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was\n",
       "exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy.  Happy\n",
       "had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his\n",

       "ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun.  But while she\n",
       "wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that\n",

       "\n",
       "\"By feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged me\n",
       "to be secret.  I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of\n",
       "the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in\n",
       "them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to\n",
       "satisfy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne seemed much struck.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Four months!--and yet you loved him!\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes. But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was\n",
       "dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt.\n",
       "Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion.  I would not have\n",
       "you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer\n",
       "materially myself.  I have many things to support me.  I am not\n",
       "conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my\n",
       "own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther.\n",
       "I acquit Edward of essential misconduct.  I wish him very happy; and I\n",
       "am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour\n",
       "some regret, in the end he must become so.  Lucy does not want sense,\n",
       "and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And\n",
       "after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a\n",
       "single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one's\n",
       "happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not\n",
       "meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward\n",
       "will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and\n",
       "understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to\n",
       "forget that he ever thought another superior to HER.\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If such is your way of thinking,\" said Marianne, \"if the loss of what\n",
       "is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your\n",
       "resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be\n",
       "wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For\n",
       "four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without\n",
       "being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it\n",
       "would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to\n",
       "you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.-- It was told\n",
       "me,--it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose\n",
       "prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought,\n",
       "with triumph.-- This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to\n",
       "oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most\n",
       "deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her\n",
       "hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known\n",
       "myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one\n",
       "circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing\n",
       "has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to\n",
       "me.-- I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and\n",
       "the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an\n",
       "attachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been\n",
       "going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only\n",
       "unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you\n",
       "may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  The composure of mind with which\n",
       "I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the\n",
       "consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of\n",
       "constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of\n",
       "themselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No,\n",
       "Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing\n",
       "could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest\n",
       "friends--from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy.\"--\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh! Elinor,\" she cried, \"you have made me hate myself for ever.--How\n",

       "have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only\n",
       "suffering for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can\n",

       "to do it away.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The tenderest caresses followed this confession.  In such a frame of\n",
       "mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her\n",
       "whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged\n",
       "never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of\n",
       "bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of\n",
       "dislike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring\n",
       "them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These\n",
       "were great concessions;--but where Marianne felt that she had injured,\n",
       "no reparation could be too much for her to make.\n",
       "\n",
       "She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.--She\n",
       "attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an\n",
       "unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard\n",
       "three times to say, \"Yes, ma'am.\"--She listened to her praise of Lucy\n",
       "with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings\n",
       "talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her\n",
       "throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel\n",
       "equal to any thing herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their\n",
       "brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful\n",
       "affair, and bring them news of his wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have heard, I suppose,\" said he with great solemnity, as soon as\n",
       "he was seated, \"of the very shocking discovery that took place under\n",
       "our roof yesterday.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your sister,\" he continued, \"has suffered dreadfully.  Mrs. Ferrars\n",
       "too--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but I\n",
       "will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us\n",
       "quite overcome.  Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday.  But I\n",
       "would not alarm you too much.  Donavan says there is nothing materially\n",
       "to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution\n",
       "equal to any thing.  She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an\n",
       "angel!  She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one\n",
       "cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting with such\n",
       "ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence\n",
       "had been placed!  It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart,\n",
       "that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she\n",
       "thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved\n",
       "girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished\n",
       "very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your\n",
       "kind friend there, was attending her daughter.  And now to be so\n",
       "rewarded!  'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her\n",
       "affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is\n",
       "not to be described.  While she with the truest affection had been\n",
       "planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that\n",
       "he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a\n",
       "suspicion could never have entered her head!  If she suspected ANY\n",
       "prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter.  'THERE, to\n",
       "be sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself safe.' She was quite\n",
       "in an agony.  We consulted together, however, as to what should be\n",
       "done, and at last she determined to send for Edward.  He came.  But I\n",
       "am sorry to relate what ensued.  All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to\n",
       "make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well\n",
       "suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no avail.\n",
       "Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded.  I never thought Edward\n",
       "so stubborn, so unfeeling before.  His mother explained to him her\n",
       "liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she\n",
       "would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax,\n",
       "brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew\n",
       "desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he\n",
       "still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain\n",
       "penury that must attend the match.  His own two thousand pounds she\n",
       "protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far\n",
       "would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he\n",
       "were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she\n",
       "would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands\n",
       "together, and cried, \"Gracious God!  can this be possible!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well may you wonder, Marianne,\" replied her brother, \"at the obstinacy\n",
       "which could resist such arguments as these.  Your exclamation is very\n",
       "natural.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and\n",
       "forbore.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All this, however,\" he continued, \"was urged in vain.  Edward said\n",
       "very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner.\n",
       "Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement.  He would\n",
       "stand to it, cost him what it might.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then,\" cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be\n",
       "silent, \"he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.\n",
       "Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a\n",
       "rascal.  I have some little concern in the business, as well as\n",
       "yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a\n",
       "better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good\n",
       "husband.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open\n",
       "to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially\n",
       "anybody of good fortune.  He therefore replied, without any resentment,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,\n",
       "madam.  Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,\n",
       "but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.\n",
       "And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her\n",
       "uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune\n",
       "as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In\n",
       "short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom\n",
       "you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  We all wish her extremely happy;\n",
       "and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every\n",
       "conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt.  It has\n",
       "been dignified and liberal.  Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear\n",
       "it will be a bad one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung\n",
       "for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for a\n",
       "woman who could not reward him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"and how did it end?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is\n",
       "dismissed for ever from his mother's notice.  He left her house\n",
       "yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do\n",
       "not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor young man!--and what is to become of him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What, indeed, ma'am!  It is a melancholy consideration.  Born to the\n",
       "prospect of such affluence!  I cannot conceive a situation more\n",
       "deplorable.  The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on\n",
       "it?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but for\n",
       "his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two\n",
       "thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand\n",
       "pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition.  We must\n",
       "all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our\n",
       "power to assist him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor young man!\" cried Mrs. Jennings, \"I am sure he should be very\n",
       "welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I\n",
       "could see him.  It is not fit that he should be living about at his own\n",
       "charge now, at lodgings and taverns.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she\n",
       "could not forbear smiling at the form of it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If he would only have done as well by himself,\" said John Dashwood,\n",
       "\"as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been\n",
       "in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing.  But as it\n",
       "is, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him.  And there is one\n",
       "thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his\n",
       "mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle\n",
       "THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's, on\n",
       "proper conditions.  I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking\n",
       "over the business.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well!\" said Mrs. Jennings, \"that is HER revenge.  Everybody has a way\n",
       "of their own.  But I don't think mine would be, to make one son\n",
       "independent, because another had plagued me.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his\n",
       "visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really\n",
       "believed there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, and\n",
       "that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away;\n",
       "leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but only\n",
       "Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit.  THEY only knew how\n",
       "little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the\n",
       "consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain\n",
       "to him in the loss of friends and fortune.  Elinor gloried in his\n",
       "integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his\n",
       "punishment.  But though confidence between them was, by this public\n",
       "discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which\n",
       "either of them were fond of dwelling when alone.  Elinor avoided it\n",
       "upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the\n",
       "too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's\n",
       "continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and\n",
       "Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic\n",

       "comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.\n",
       "\n",
       "She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had\n",
       "hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of\n",
       "continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never\n",
       "exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence,\n",
       "without the hope of amendment.  Her mind was so much weakened that she\n",
       "still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only\n",
       "dispirited her more.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs\n",
       "in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings.  But though so much of the\n",
       "matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had\n",
       "enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after\n",
       "more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and\n",
       "inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the\n",
       "hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them\n",
       "within that time.\n",
       "\n",
       "The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so\n",
       "fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens,\n",
       "though it was only the second week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and Elinor\n",
       "were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were\n",
       "again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather\n",

       "\n",
       "An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they\n",

       "with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was\n",
       "herself left to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing of the Willoughbys,\n",
       "nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by\n",
       "any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her.  But at last\n",
       "she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who,\n",
       "though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting\n",
       "them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I am monstrous glad of it.  Good gracious!  I have had such a time of\n",

       "she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me\n",
       "again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are\n",

       "Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and\n",
       "Saturday, and did not know what was become of him.  Once Lucy thought\n",
       "to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that.  However this\n",
       "morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came\n",
       "out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been\n",

       "matter directly, and leave him shift for himself.  I heard him say all\n",
       "this as plain as could possibly be.  And it was entirely for HER sake,\n",
       "and upon HER account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon\n",
       "his own.  I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired\n",

       "to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she\n",

       "confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as\n",

       "for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if\n",
       "any place could give her ease, Barton must do it.  Elinor was hardly\n",
       "less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent\n",
       "on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the\n",
       "difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought\n",
       "to acknowledge.  She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts\n",
       "towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to\n",
       "their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her\n",
       "good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from\n",
       "home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more\n",
       "eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about\n",
       "the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both\n",
       "her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with\n",
       "them.  This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy\n",
       "of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by\n",
       "Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his\n",
       "manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy,\n",
       "induced her to accept it with pleasure.\n",

       "Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such\n",

       "beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant\n",
       "might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no\n",
       "occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be\n",
       "at home in little more than three weeks' time.  As Marianne's affection\n",

       "Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her\n",
       "design; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, every\n",
       "thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;--and\n",

       "reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the\n",

       "observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even\n",
       "changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by\n",
       "the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep\n",
       "herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with\n",
       "agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her\n",
       "employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the\n",

       "of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be\n",

       "doubt.  She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so;\n",
       "but supposed it to be the proper etiquette.  What Elinor said in reply\n",
       "she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that\n",
       "she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings\n",
       "commended her in her heart for being so honest.  They then talked on\n",
       "for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too\n",
       "much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen\n",
       "in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he\n",

       "business.\n",

       "Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her\n",

       "properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the\n",
       "information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her\n",
       "upon this greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment and confusion\n",
       "were very great on his so sudden appearance.  She had not seen him\n",
       "before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his\n",
       "knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of\n",
       "what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her\n",
       "feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes.  He too was much\n",
       "distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of\n",
       "embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on\n",
       "first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to\n",
       "be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could\n",
       "say any thing, after taking a chair.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mrs. Jennings told me,\" said he, \"that you wished to speak with me, at\n",

       "you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been\n",
       "extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister;\n",
       "especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable that\n",
       "I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again.  I go to Oxford\n",
       "tomorrow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You would not have gone, however,\" said Elinor, recovering herself,\n",

       "possible, \"without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been\n",
       "able to give them in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she\n",
       "said.  I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on\n",
       "the point of communicating by paper.  I am charged with a most\n",
       "agreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.)\n",
       "Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to\n",
       "say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure\n",
       "in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes\n",
       "it were more valuable.  Allow me to congratulate you on having so\n",
       "respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the\n",

       "\n",
       "What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected\n",

       "unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which I\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You are very much mistaken.  I do assure you that you owe it entirely,\n",
       "at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's\n",
       "discernment of it.  I have had no hand in it.  I did not even know,\n",
       "till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it\n",
       "ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift.\n",
       "As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he\n",
       "HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe\n",
       "nothing to my solicitation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but\n",
       "she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of\n",
       "Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably\n",
       "contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently\n",
       "entered it.  For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had\n",
       "ceased to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability.  I have\n",
       "always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him\n",

       "\n",

       "such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost\n",
       "close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he\n",
       "SHOULD be all this.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her\n",
       "a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he\n",

       "mansion-house much greater.\n",
       "\n",

       "earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his\n",
       "happiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on HIS,\n",
       "with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of\n",
       "expressing it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I see him again,\" said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him\n",
       "out, \"I shall see him the husband of Lucy.\"\n",

       "Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people\n",
       "whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a\n",
       "great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important\n",

       "it again as soon as Elinor appeared.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, my dear,\" she cried, \"I sent you up to the young man.  Did not I\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely.\"\n",

       "in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convinced\n",

       "quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she\n",

       "for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast\n",
       "him off likewise.  Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined\n",
       "liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannot\n",

       "never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may\n",

       "connection--you understand me--it would have been far preferable to\n",
       "her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does.  I\n",
       "was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that\n",
       "light--a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all.  'It would\n",
       "have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least evil of the two, and\n",

       "she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very\n",
       "different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM.  He laughed\n",
       "most immoderately.  The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living\n",
       "in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to\n",
       "that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a\n",
       "white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith\n",
       "and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.\n",
       "\n",

       "on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited.  It was a\n",
       "look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings,\n",
       "and gave no intelligence to him.  He was recalled from wit to wisdom,\n",
       "not by any reproof of her's, but by his own sensibility.\n",

       "of the moment--\"but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business.  Poor\n",

       "was by no means so cheerful.  Mrs. Jennings had determined very early\n",
       "in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel\n",
       "Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's\n",
       "forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence.  He\n",

       "symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, confirmed\n",
       "in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her\n",
       "letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her\n",

       "To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the\n",
       "latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its\n",

       "and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr.\n",

       "security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what\n",
       "her mistress had always thought.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her\n",
       "mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the\n",
       "heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with\n",
       "so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,\n",
       "fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had\n",
       "been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother\n",
       "arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could\n",
       "not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after\n",
       "five o'clock--arrived.  His opinion, however, made some little amends\n",
       "for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and\n",
       "unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to\n",
       "be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment\n",
       "must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was\n",
       "communicated to Elinor.  He promised to call again in the course of\n",
       "three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious\n",
       "attendant more composed than he had found them.\n",
       "\n",
       "With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to\n",
       "their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.\n",
       "Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no\n",
       "doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her\n",
       "conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the\n",
       "comfort of hope.  Her heart was really grieved.  The rapid decay, the\n",
       "early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck\n",
       "a less interested person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's compassion\n",
       "she had other claims.  She had been for three months her companion, was\n",
       "still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured,\n",
       "and long unhappy.  The distress of her sister too, particularly a\n",
       "favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings\n",
       "considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to\n",
       "herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.\n",
       "\n",

       "medicines had failed;--the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more\n",
       "quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  Elinor, catching\n",
       "all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in\n",
       "further advice.  But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something\n",
       "more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as\n",
       "confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging\n",
       "assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss\n",
       "Dashwood.  She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but she\n",
       "was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon,\n",
       "scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering from\n",
       "one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits\n",
       "oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who\n",
       "scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the\n",
       "many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment\n",
       "had brought on.  Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it\n",
       "gave fresh misery to her reflections.\n",
       "\n",
       "About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of\n",
       "disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her\n",
       "friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her\n",
       "sister's pulse;--she waited, watched, and examined it again and\n",
       "again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under\n",
       "exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to\n",
       "communicate her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination,\n",
       "to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from\n",
       "indulging a thought of its continuance;--and Elinor, conning over every\n",
       "injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope.  But it was\n",
       "too late.  Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious\n",
       "flutter, she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what.\n",
       "Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her.\n",
       "Others even arose to confirm it.  Her breath, her skin, her lips, all\n",
       "flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes\n",
       "on her with a rational, though languid, gaze.  Anxiety and hope now\n",
       "oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity\n",
       "till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his assurances,\n",
       "his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his\n",
       "expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her\n",
       "entirely out of danger.  Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the\n",
       "partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their\n",
       "late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted,\n",
       "with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the\n",
       "probability of an entire recovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her joy was of a different kind, and led\n",
       "to any thing rather than to gaiety.  Marianne restored to life, health,\n",
       "friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with\n",
       "sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent\n",
       "gratitude;--but it lead to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words,\n",
       "no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and\n",
       "strong.\n",
       "\n",
       "She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the\n",
       "whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her\n",
       "enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every\n",
       "look and every breath.  The possibility of a relapse would of course,\n",
       "in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--but when she\n",
       "saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of\n",
       "recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet,\n",
       "steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every\n",
       "doubt.\n",

       "now be travelling towards them.  The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely\n",
       "less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress of time which\n",
       "yet kept them in ignorance!\n",
       "\n",
       "At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined\n",
       "Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea.  Of breakfast she had been\n",
       "kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating\n",
       "much;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of\n",
       "content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome.  Mrs. Jennings\n",
       "would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before\n",
       "her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; but\n",
       "Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment\n",
       "about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an\n",
       "unnecessary instant.  Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs\n",
       "into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,\n",
       "left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her\n",

       "\n",
       "The night was cold and stormy.  The wind roared round the house, and\n",
       "the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,\n",
       "regarded it not.  Marianne slept through every blast; and the\n",

       "inconvenience.\n",
       "\n",
       "The clock struck eight.  Had it been ten, Elinor would have been\n",
       "convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the\n",
       "house; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of the\n",
       "ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into\n",
       "the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be\n",
       "satisfied of the truth.  She instantly saw that her ears had not\n",
       "deceived her.  The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in\n",
       "view.  By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be\n",
       "drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor\n",

       "\n",
       "Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at\n",

       "despair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was\n",
       "impossible to be calm.  All that remained to be done was to be speedy;\n",
       "and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid\n",
       "with her sister, she hurried down stairs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby,\n",

       "Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed\n",
       "the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room,\n",
       "and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by\n",
       "his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than\n",

       "Mr. Palmer was not in the house.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Had they told me,\" he cried with vehemence, \"that Mr. Palmer and all\n",

       "\"Sit down, and I will be both.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She hesitated; she knew not what to do.  The possibility of Colonel\n",
       "Brandon's arriving and finding her there, came across her.  But she had\n",
       "promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was\n",
       "engaged.  After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that\n",
       "prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best\n",
       "promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down.  He\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Your sister,\" said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--\"is out\n",

       "true? is it really true?\"\n",

       "perhaps--let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for\n",

       "cheeks--\"do you think me most a knave or a fool?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever.  She began to\n",
       "think that he must be in liquor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and\n",
       "of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this\n",
       "impression she immediately rose, saying,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I understand you,\" he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice\n",
       "perfectly calm; \"yes, I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold\n",
       "beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"At Marlborough!\"--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand\n",
       "what he would be at.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,--I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten\n",
       "minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a\n",
       "nuncheon at Marlborough.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he\n",
       "spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might\n",
       "bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she\n",
       "said, after a moment's recollection,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO--that after what\n",
       "has passed--your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon\n",
       "my notice, requires a very particular excuse.--What is it, that you\n",
       "mean by it?\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mean,\"--said he, with serious energy--\"if I can, to make you hate me\n",
       "one degree less than you do NOW.  I mean to offer some kind of\n",
       "explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart\n",
       "to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a\n",
       "blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like\n",
       "forgiveness from Ma--from your sister.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is this the real reason of your coming?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my soul it is,\"--was his answer, with a warmth which brought all\n",
       "the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made\n",
       "her think him sincere.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If that is all, you may be satisfied already,-- for Marianne DOES--she\n",
       "has LONG forgiven you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Has she?\"--he cried, in the same eager tone.-- \"Then she has forgiven\n",
       "me before she ought to have done it.  But she shall forgive me again,\n",
       "and on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Elinor bowed her assent.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not know,\" said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and\n",
       "thoughtfulness on his own,--\"how YOU may have accounted for my\n",
       "behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have\n",
       "imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is\n",
       "worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing.  When I first\n",
       "became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view\n",
       "in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged\n",
       "to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.\n",
       "Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not but\n",
       "please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a\n",
       "kind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE\n",
       "was, that my heart should have been so insensible!  But at first I must\n",
       "confess, my vanity only was elevated by it.  Careless of her happiness,\n",
       "thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had\n",
       "always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every\n",
       "means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design\n",
       "of returning her affection.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most\n",
       "angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me\n",
       "to listen any longer.  Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by\n",
       "any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the\n",
       "subject.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,\" he replied, \"My fortune was\n",
       "never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of\n",
       "associating with people of better income than myself.  Every year since\n",
       "my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and\n",
       "though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet\n",
       "that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for\n",
       "some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a\n",
       "woman of fortune.  To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not\n",
       "a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness, selfishness,\n",
       "cruelty--which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss\n",
       "Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting in this manner,\n",
       "trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.--But\n",
       "one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish\n",
       "vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I\n",
       "did not THEN know what it was to love.  But have I ever known it?--Well\n",
       "may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my\n",
       "feelings to vanity, to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have\n",
       "sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative poverty,\n",
       "which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its\n",
       "horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that\n",
       "could make it a blessing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You did then,\" said Elinor, a little softened, \"believe yourself at\n",
       "one time attached to her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such\n",
       "tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes, I\n",
       "found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the\n",
       "happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my\n",
       "intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless.  Even\n",
       "THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I\n",
       "allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment\n",
       "of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my\n",
       "circumstances were so greatly embarrassed.  I will not reason here--nor\n",
       "will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than\n",
       "absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already\n",
       "bound.  The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with\n",
       "great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself\n",
       "contemptible and wretched for ever.  At last, however, my resolution\n",
       "was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone,\n",
       "to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly\n",
       "assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to\n",
       "display.  But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours that\n",
       "were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her\n",
       "in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin\n",
       "all my resolution, and with it all my comfort.  A discovery took\n",
       "place,\"--here he hesitated and looked down.--\"Mrs. Smith had somehow or\n",
       "other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest\n",
       "it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have,\" returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart\n",

       "\"Remember,\" cried Willoughby, \"from whom you received the account.\n",

       "character ought to have been respected by me.  I do not mean to justify\n",
       "myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have\n",
       "nothing to urge--that because she was injured she was irreproachable,\n",
       "and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint.  If the violence of\n",
       "her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not mean,\n",
       "however, to defend myself.  Her affection for me deserved better\n",
       "treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness\n",
       "which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return.  I\n",
       "wish--I heartily wish it had never been.  But I have injured more than\n",
       "herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me--(may I say\n",
       "it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind--Oh! how\n",
       "infinitely superior!\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say\n",

       "not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of\n",
       "understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.\n",
       "You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in\n",
       "Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was\n",
       "reduced to the extremest indigence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it,\" he warmly replied; \"I did not\n",

       "ignorance of the world--every thing was against me.  The matter itself\n",
       "I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it.  She was\n",
       "previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in\n",
       "general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,\n",
       "the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my\n",
       "present visit.  In short, it ended in a total breach.  By one measure I\n",
       "might have saved myself.  In the height of her morality, good woman!\n",
       "she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza.  That could\n",
       "not be--and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house.\n",
       "The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was\n",
       "spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be.  The\n",
       "struggle was great--but it ended too soon.  My affection for Marianne,\n",
       "my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all insufficient\n",

       "ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to\n",
       "feel, and expensive society had increased.  I had reason to believe\n",
       "myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I\n",
       "persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained\n",

       "Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some\n",
       "apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement.  But\n",
       "whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a\n",
       "point of long debate.  To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and\n",
       "I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my\n",
       "resolution.  In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity,\n",
       "as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable,\n",
       "and left her miserable--and left her hoping never to see her again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?\" said Elinor, reproachfully; \"a note\n",

       "do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her\n",

       "resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the\n",
       "sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be\n",
       "connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,\n",
       "and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without\n",
       "the atonement of a smile.  After dinner she would try her piano-forte.\n",
       "She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an\n",
       "opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their\n",
       "favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his\n",
       "hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head, put the music\n",
       "aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of\n",
       "feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring\n",

       "Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would\n",

       "behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last\n",
       "autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of\n",
       "kindness to others.  I saw that my own feelings had prepared my\n",
       "sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me\n",
       "to the grave.  My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by\n",
       "myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the\n",
       "time to be wrong.  Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I\n",
       "did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such\n",
       "feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder\n",
       "that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for\n",
       "atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once.  Had I\n",

       "I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! How could you have\n",

       "I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing\n",
       "indulged.  Every body seemed injured by me.  The kindness, the\n",
       "unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful\n",
       "contempt.  To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every\n",
       "common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart\n",
       "hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very\n",
       "attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as they\n",
       "deserve, I had given less than their due.  But you,--you above all,\n",
       "above my mother, had been wronged by me.  I, and only I, knew your\n",
       "heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any\n",

       "alone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had\n",
       "believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or\n",
       "friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting\n",

       "repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard.\n",
       "Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the\n",

       "selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which\n",
       "afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of\n",
       "it, and which finally carried him from Barton.  His own enjoyment, or\n",

       "unembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only\n",
       "that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself.\n",
       "But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been\n",
       "happy?--The inconveniences would have been different.  He would then\n",
       "have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are\n",
       "removed, he now reckons as nothing.  He would have had a wife of whose\n",
       "temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always\n",
       "necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank\n",

       "The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every\n",

       "before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me.  Not a soul\n",
       "suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!  came\n",

       "treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion\n",
       "of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to\n",

       "the rest followed in course.  Instead of talking of Edward, they came\n",
       "gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always\n",
       "more to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an\n",
       "interest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily\n",
       "evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother.  He was\n",
       "proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of\n",
       "marrying privately without his mother's consent.  What immediately\n",
       "followed is known.  They passed some months in great happiness at\n",

       "longer unpardoned.  But perseverance in humility of conduct and\n",
       "messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for\n",
       "the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty\n",
       "notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards,\n",
       "by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence.\n",

       "might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every\n",
       "particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and\n",
       "from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no\n",

       "interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,\n",
       "in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak\n",

       "\n",
       "How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\n",

       "difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\n",
       "Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and\n",
       "domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\n",
       "solitude.  She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for\n",
       "her.  He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\n",
       "\n",
       "The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\n",
       "not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\n",
       "for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\n",
       "or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\n",

       "to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\n",

       "first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had many\n",
       "acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\n",
       "not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\n",
       "even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\n",
       "sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\n",
       "and made it necessary to be cheerful.  His spirits required support.\n",
       "He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was\n",
       "used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.\n",
       "Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was\n",
       "by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could\n",
       "ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a\n",
       "match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor\n",
       "too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able\n",
       "to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he\n",

       "herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she\n",
       "had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.  Emma smiled and\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\n",
       "which for the last two or three generations had been rising into\n",
       "gentility and property.  He had received a good education, but, on\n",
       "succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\n",
       "for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\n",
       "and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by\n",
       "entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\n",
       "\n",
       "Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\n",
       "military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great\n",
       "Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was\n",
       "surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and\n",
       "who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\n",
       "fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the\n",
       "family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took\n",
       "place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who\n",
       "threw her off with due decorum.  It was an unsuitable connexion, and\n",
       "did not produce much happiness.  Mrs. Weston ought to have found more\n",
       "in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him\n",
       "think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being\n",
       "in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not\n",
       "the best.  She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of\n",
       "her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at\n",
       "that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her\n",
       "former home.  They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing\n",
       "in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but\n",
       "she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill\n",
       "of Enscombe.\n",
       "\n",
       "Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\n",
       "as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\n",
       "the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he\n",
       "was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\n",
       "From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.  The boy\n",
       "had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\n",
       "mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\n",
       "Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\n",
       "creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\n",
       "of the little Frank soon after her decease.  Some scruples and some\n",
       "reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\n",
       "were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\n",
       "care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\n",
       "to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.\n",
       "\n",
       "A complete change of life became desirable.  He quitted the militia and\n",
       "engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\n",
       "London, which afforded him a favourable opening.  It was a concern\n",
       "which brought just employment enough.  He had still a small house in\n",
       "Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\n",
       "occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\n",
       "years of his life passed cheerfully away.  He had, by that time,\n",
       "realised an easy competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little\n",

       "is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be.  But\n",
       "on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be\n",
       "an inducement to her to read more herself.  They will read together.\n",
       "She means it, I know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years\n",
       "old.  I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times\n",
       "of books that she meant to read regularly through--and very good lists\n",
       "they were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes\n",
       "alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.  The list she drew up\n",
       "when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\n",
       "credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\n",
       "out a very good list now.  But I have done with expecting any course of\n",
       "steady reading from Emma.  She will never submit to any thing requiring\n",
       "industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\n",
       "understanding.  Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\n",
       "affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade\n",
       "her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought so\n",
       "_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting\n",
       "to do any thing I wished.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as\n",
       "_that_,\"--said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had\n",
       "done.  \"But I,\" he soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over\n",
       "my senses, must still see, hear, and remember.  Emma is spoiled by\n",
       "being the cleverest of her family.  At ten years old, she had the\n",
       "misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister\n",
       "at seventeen.  She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and\n",
       "diffident.  And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of\n",
       "the house and of you all.  In her mother she lost the only person able\n",
       "to cope with her.  She inherits her mother's talents, and must have\n",
       "been under subjection to her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\n",
       "recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another\n",
       "situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\n",
       "any body.  I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" said he, smiling.  \"You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\n",
       "wife, but not at all for a governess.  But you were preparing yourself\n",
       "to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.  You might\n",
       "not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\n",
       "promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on\n",
       "the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and\n",
       "doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a\n",
       "wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you.  There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\n",
       "such a man as Mr. Weston.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and\n",
       "that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.\n",
       "We will not despair, however.  Weston may grow cross from the\n",
       "wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope not _that_.--It is not likely.  No, Mr. Knightley, do not\n",
       "foretell vexation from that quarter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not I, indeed.  I only name possibilities.  I do not pretend to Emma's\n",
       "genius for foretelling and guessing.  I hope, with all my heart, the\n",
       "young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\n",
       "Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.  I think her\n",
       "the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.  She\n",
       "knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.  She\n",
       "is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because\n",
       "undesigned.  Her ignorance is hourly flattery.  How can Emma imagine\n",
       "she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a\n",
       "delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that\n",
       "_she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance.  Hartfield will only put her out\n",
       "of conceit with all the other places she belongs to.  She will grow\n",
       "just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and\n",
       "circumstances have placed her home.  I am much mistaken if Emma's\n",
       "doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl\n",
       "adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\n",
       "life.--They only give a little polish.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?\n",
       "Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pretty! say beautiful rather.  Can you imagine any thing nearer\n",
       "perfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\n",
       "seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.  But I am a\n",
       "partial old friend.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\n",
       "open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\n",
       "and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\n",
       "There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\n",
       "glance.  One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;'\n",
       "now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\n",
       "grown-up health.  She is loveliness itself.  Mr. Knightley, is not she?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\" he replied.  \"I think her\n",
       "all you describe.  I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\n",
       "that I do not think her personally vain.  Considering how very handsome\n",
       "she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\n",
       "another way.  Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\n",
       "Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\n",
       "doing them any harm.  With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an\n",
       "excellent creature.  Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\n",
       "sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\n",
       "trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\n",

       "affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not\n",

       "she cared for.  It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in\n",
       "love with a proper object.  I should like to see Emma in love, and in\n",

       "direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\n",
       "purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\n",
       "Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\n",
       "and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\n",
       "admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of\n",
       "creating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any\n",
       "occasion for.  She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the\n",
       "fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already.  She had no\n",
       "scruple with regard to him.  He talked of Harriet, and praised her so\n",
       "warmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little\n",
       "time would not add.  His perception of the striking improvement of\n",
       "Harriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of\n",
       "the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have given Miss Smith all that she required,\" said he; \"you have\n",
       "made her graceful and easy.  She was a beautiful creature when she came\n",
       "to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\n",
       "infinitely superior to what she received from nature.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\n",
       "drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints.  She had all the\n",
       "natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself.  I\n",
       "have done very little.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If it were admissible to contradict a lady,\" said the gallant Mr.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\n",
       "taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.  So much superadded\n",
       "decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.  I never met with a\n",
       "disposition more truly amiable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no doubt of it.\" And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\n",
       "animation, which had a vast deal of the lover.  She was not less\n",
       "pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish\n",
       "of hers, to have Harriet's picture.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\" said she: \"did you\n",

       "\n",
       "Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\n",
       "with a very interesting naivete,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! dear, no, never.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\n",
       "give any money for it.  I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\n",
       "You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\n",
       "passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\n",
       "was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.  But from one cause or\n",
       "another, I gave it up in disgust.  But really, I could almost venture,\n",
       "if Harriet would sit to me.  It would be such a delight to have her\n",
       "picture!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let me entreat you,\" cried Mr. Elton; \"it would indeed be a delight!\n",
       "Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in\n",
       "favour of your friend.  I know what your drawings are.  How could you\n",
       "suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\n",
       "landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\n",
       "figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\n",
       "likenesses? You know nothing of drawing.  Don't pretend to be in\n",
       "raptures about mine.  Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.  \"Well, if\n",
       "you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try\n",
       "what I can do.  Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a\n",
       "likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the\n",
       "eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have\n",
       "not a doubt of your success.  Pray, pray attempt it.  As you will do\n",
       "it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit.  She thinks\n",
       "so little of her own beauty.  Did not you observe her manner of\n",
       "answering me? How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be\n",
       "drawn?'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.  It was not lost on me.  But\n",

       "\n",
       "Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\n",
       "and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\n",
       "earnest pressing of both the others.  Emma wished to go to work\n",
       "directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\n",
       "attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\n",
       "they might decide together on the best size for Harriet.  Her many\n",
       "beginnings were displayed.  Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\n",
       "pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.  She had\n",
       "always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\n",
       "drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\n",
       "she would ever submit to.  She played and sang;--and drew in almost\n",
       "every style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had\n",
       "she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad\n",
       "to command, and ought not to have failed of.  She was not much deceived\n",
       "as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\n",
       "unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\n",
       "accomplishment often higher than it deserved.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the\n",
       "most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had\n",
       "there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two\n",
       "companions would have been the same.  They were both in ecstasies.  A\n",
       "likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be\n",
       "capital.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma.  \"I had only my own\n",

       "her.  There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant\n",
       "figure!--and the face not unlike.  I should have made a good likeness\n",
       "of her, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to\n",
       "have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet.  Then, here\n",
       "come all my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are,\n",
       "Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and\n",
       "any one of them might do for any one of the rest.  She was so eager to\n",
       "have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making\n",
       "children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be\n",
       "very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion,\n",
       "unless they are coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were.\n",
       "Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby.  I took him as he was\n",
       "sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as\n",
       "you would wish to see.  He had nestled down his head most conveniently.\n",
       "That's very like.  I am rather proud of little George.  The corner of\n",
       "the sofa is very good.  Then here is my last,\"--unclosing a pretty\n",
       "sketch of a gentleman in small size, whole-length--\"my last and my\n",
       "best--my brother, Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being\n",
       "finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take\n",
       "another likeness.  I could not help being provoked; for after all my\n",
       "pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs.\n",
       "Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like)--only too\n",
       "handsome--too flattering--but that was a fault on the right side--after\n",
       "all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of--\"Yes, it was a\n",
       "little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice.\" We had had a\n",
       "great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.  It was made a\n",
       "great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I\n",
       "never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable\n",
       "likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I\n",
       "said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again.  But for\n",
       "Harriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and\n",

       "\n",
       "The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion\n",
       "for Emma's services towards her friend.  Harriet had been at Hartfield,\n",
       "as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\n",
       "return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been talked\n",
       "of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\n",
       "extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.  Half a\n",
       "minute brought it all out.  She had heard, as soon as she got back to\n",
       "Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\n",
       "finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\n",
       "little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\n",
       "opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs\n",
       "which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this\n",
       "letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal\n",
       "of marriage.  \"Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did\n",
       "not know what to do.  Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very\n",
       "good letter, at least she thought so.  And he wrote as if he really\n",
       "loved her very much--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast\n",
       "as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--\" Emma was\n",
       "half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" she cried, \"the young man is determined not to lose any\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Will you read the letter?\" cried Harriet.  \"Pray do.  I'd rather you\n",
       "would.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was not sorry to be pressed.  She read, and was surprized.  The\n",
       "style of the letter was much above her expectation.  There were not\n",
       "merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have\n",
       "disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and\n",
       "unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of\n",
       "the writer.  It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,\n",
       "liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.  She paused over it,\n",
       "while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a \"Well,\n",
       "well,\" and was at last forced to add, \"Is it a good letter? or is it\n",
       "too short?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,\" replied Emma rather slowly--\"so good\n",
       "a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\n",
       "sisters must have helped him.  I can hardly imagine the young man whom\n",
       "I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\n",
       "left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\n",
       "no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\n",
       "woman.  No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\n",
       "talent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen in\n",
       "hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words.  It is so with some\n",
       "men.  Yes, I understand the sort of mind.  Vigorous, decided, with\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.  You will\n",
       "express yourself very properly, I am sure.  There is no danger of your\n",
       "not being intelligible, which is the first thing.  Your meaning must be\n",
       "unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and\n",
       "concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\n",
       "present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded.  You need\n",

       "disappointment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You think I ought to refuse him then,\" said Harriet, looking down.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\n",
       "doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\n",
       "under a mistake.  I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you\n",
       "feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer.  I had imagined you\n",
       "were consulting me only as to the wording of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet was silent.  With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.  I will have nothing to do\n",
       "with it.  This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\" said Harriet,\n",
       "contemplating the letter.  For a little while Emma persevered in her\n",
       "silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\n",
       "letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\n",
       "to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to\n",
       "refuse him.  If she can hesitate as to 'Yes,' she ought to say 'No'\n",
       "directly.  It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful\n",
       "feelings, with half a heart.  I thought it my duty as a friend, and\n",
       "older than yourself, to say thus much to you.  But do not imagine that\n",
       "I want to influence you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would\n",

       "say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be\n",
       "hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,'\n",
       "perhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not for the world,\" said Emma, smiling graciously, \"would I advise you\n",
       "either way.  You must be the best judge of your own happiness.  If you\n",
       "prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\n",
       "agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\n",
       "hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this\n",
       "moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\n",

       "moment whom are you thinking of?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned\n",
       "away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the\n",
       "letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about\n",
       "without regard.  Emma waited the result with impatience, but not\n",
       "without strong hopes.  At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as\n",
       "well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\n",
       "what you ought.  While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings\n",
       "to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no\n",
       "hesitation in approving.  Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.  It\n",
       "would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been\n",
       "the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.  While you were in the\n",
       "smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not\n",
       "influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.  I could\n",
       "not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.  Now I am\n",
       "secure of you for ever.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\n",

       "been spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to\n",
       "have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in\n",
       "every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as\n",
       "possible just at present.  She was obliged to go the next morning for\n",
       "an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that\n",
       "she should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\n",
       "\n",
       "While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\n",
       "Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\n",
       "mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and\n",
       "was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of\n",
       "his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.  Mr.\n",
       "Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have reason to think,\" he replied, \"that Harriet Smith will soon\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.  Will that do? He came to\n",
       "the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.  He\n",
       "knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I\n",
       "believe, considers me as one of his best friends.  He came to ask me\n",
       "whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;\n",
       "whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his\n",
       "choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being\n",
       "considered (especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line\n",
       "of society above him.  I was very much pleased with all that he said.\n",
       "I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.  He always\n",
       "speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging.\n",
       "He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all\n",
       "proposed doing in the event of his marriage.  He is an excellent young\n",
       "man, both as son and brother.  I had no hesitation in advising him to\n",
       "marry.  He proved to me that he could afford it; and that being the\n",
       "case, I was convinced he could not do better.  I praised the fair lady\n",
       "too, and altogether sent him away very happy.  If he had never esteemed\n",
       "my opinion before, he would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare\n",
       "say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever\n",
       "had.  This happened the night before last.  Now, as we may fairly\n",
       "suppose, he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the\n",
       "lady, and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not\n",
       "unlikely that he should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be\n",
       "detained by a visitor, without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\n",
       "through a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\n",
       "did not speak yesterday?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it; but\n",
       "it may be inferred.  Was not she the whole day with you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what you\n",
       "have told me.  He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was\n",
       "refused.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\n",
       "Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he\n",
       "stood up, in tall indignation, and said,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.  What is the\n",
       "foolish girl about?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always incomprehensible to a man\n",
       "that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.  A man always\n",
       "imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.  But what is the\n",
       "meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\n",
       "so; but I hope you are mistaken.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.  Emma, this is your\n",
       "doing.  You persuaded her to refuse him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\n",
       "feel that I had done wrong.  Mr. Martin is a very respectable young\n",
       "man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather\n",
       "surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.  By your\n",
       "account, he does seem to have had some scruples.  It is a pity that\n",
       "they were ever got over.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not Harriet's equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\n",
       "with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he is not\n",
       "her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\n",
       "situation.  Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you.  What\n",
       "are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to\n",
       "any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\n",
       "nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\n",
       "certainly no respectable relations.  She is known only as\n",
       "parlour-boarder at a common school.  She is not a sensible girl, nor a\n",
       "girl of any information.  She has been taught nothing useful, and is\n",
       "too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.  At her\n",
       "age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very\n",
       "likely ever to have any that can avail her.  She is pretty, and she is\n",
       "good tempered, and that is all.  My only scruple in advising the match\n",
       "was on his account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion\n",
       "for him.  I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do\n",
       "much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he\n",
       "could not do worse.  But I could not reason so to a man in love, and\n",
       "was willing to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that\n",
       "sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily\n",
       "led aright and turn out very well.  The advantage of the match I felt\n",
       "to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)\n",
       "that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.  Even\n",
       "_your_ satisfaction I made sure of.  It crossed my mind immediately\n",
       "that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake\n",
       "of her being settled so well.  I remember saying to myself, 'Even Emma,\n",
       "with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\n",
       "any such thing.  What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\n",
       "his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\n",
       "friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\n",
       "whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\n",
       "should think it possible for me to have such feelings.  I assure you\n",
       "mine are very different.  I must think your statement by no means fair.\n",
       "You are not just to Harriet's claims.  They would be estimated very\n",
       "differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\n",
       "of the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\n",
       "society.--The sphere in which she moves is much above his.--It would be\n",
       "a degradation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\n",

       "\n",
       "\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\n",
       "be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.  She is not to pay\n",
       "for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\n",
       "whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\n",
       "is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is very\n",
       "liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\n",
       "comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me;\n",
       "that she associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend,\n",
       "will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may have\n",
       "had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\n",
       "their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\n",

       "Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs.\n",

       "evidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.\n",
       "She desired nothing better herself.  Till you chose to turn her into a\n",
       "friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition\n",
       "beyond it.  She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the\n",
       "summer.  She had no sense of superiority then.  If she has it now, you\n",
       "have given it.  You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma.  Robert\n",
       "Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded\n",
       "of her not being disinclined to him.  I know him well.  He has too much\n",
       "real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion.\n",
       "And as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know.\n",
       "Depend upon it he had encouragement.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\n",
       "unjust to Harriet.  Harriet's claims to marry well are not so\n",
       "contemptible as you represent them.  She is not a clever girl, but she\n",
       "has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\n",
       "her understanding spoken of so slightingly.  Waiving that point,\n",
       "however, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and\n",
       "good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\n",
       "they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\n",
       "is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\n",
       "people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\n",
       "philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\n",
       "till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\n",
       "faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of\n",
       "being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\n",
       "among many, consequently a claim to be nice.  Her good-nature, too, is\n",
       "not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\n",
       "sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\n",
       "great readiness to be pleased with other people.  I am very much\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\n",

       "\n",
       "\"To be sure!\" cried she playfully.  \"I know _that_ is the feeling of\n",

       "inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery\n",
       "of her parentage came to be revealed.  Let her marry Robert Martin, and\n",
       "she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her\n",

       "\n",

       "He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her.\n",
       "She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time\n",

       "of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting\n",
       "with Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas.  The\n",
       "dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and\n",
       "when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any\n",
       "such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\n",

       "of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\n",
       "such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\n",
       "she was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\n",
       "resentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about.  He\n",

       "inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be\n",
       "rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did\n",
       "not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war\n",
       "with all interested motives.  Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of\n",
       "course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to\n",
       "feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable\n",
       "prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming\n",
       "degree of prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\n",
       "to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.  Miss Nash had been\n",
       "telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\n",
       "delight.  Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,\n",

       "found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\n",
       "London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\n",

       "not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\n",
       "enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\n",

       "she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\n",

       "dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\n",
       "they would both be soon after her.  This would not do; she immediately\n",

       "without any obligation of waiting for her.  She gained on them,\n",
       "however, involuntarily:  the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather\n",
       "slow; and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently\n",
       "in a conversation which interested them.  Mr. Elton was speaking with\n",
       "animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\n",

       "Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\n",

       "interest.  Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had\n",
       "been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays\n",
       "of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it\n",

       "their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not\n",
       "be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and\n",

       "the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\n",
       "Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of\n",
       "nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.  The bustle and joy of\n",
       "such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and\n",
       "variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion\n",
       "which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have\n",
       "endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the\n",

       "Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,\n",

       "wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so\n",
       "tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher\n",
       "ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.  She could never see\n",
       "a fault in any of them.  She was not a woman of strong understanding or\n",
       "any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited\n",
       "also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health,\n",
       "over-careful of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves,\n",
       "and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be\n",

       "and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that\n",
       "any natural defects in it should not be increased.  The extreme\n",
       "sweetness of her temper must hurt his.  He had all the clearness and\n",

       "ungracious, or say a severe thing.\n",
       "\n",

       "passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella's sister,\n",
       "but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\n",
       "praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\n",
       "compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all\n",
       "in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\n",
       "forbearance towards her father.  There he had not always the patience\n",
       "that could have been wished.  Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and\n",
       "fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\n",

       "apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not.\n",
       "The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest\n",
       "feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass\n",
       "away in unsullied cordiality.  They had not been long seated and\n",
       "composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a\n",

       "is really as kind as herself.  Papa, if you speak in that melancholy\n",
       "way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all.  Every body\n",
       "must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought\n",
       "also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our\n",
       "missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which\n",
       "is the exact truth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just as it should be,\" said Mr. John Knightley, \"and just as I hoped\n",
       "it was from your letters.  Her wish of shewing you attention could not\n",
       "be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\n",
       "easy.  I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\n",

       "the poor husband.  I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\n",
       "claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.  As for\n",

       "there is nothing he does not deserve.  I believe he is one of the very\n",
       "best-tempered men that ever existed.  Excepting yourself and your\n",

       "\"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\n",
       "proper, handsome letter it was.  She shewed it to me.  I thought it\n",
       "very well done of him indeed.  Whether it was his own idea you know,\n",
       "one cannot tell.  He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\"\n",

       "exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great\n",
       "deal of pleasure.  I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated\n",
       "Sept. 28th--and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on;\n",

       "perfectly.\"\n",

       "There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his\n",

       "he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\n",
       "or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\n",
       "for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\n",

       "undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and\n",
       "pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met\n",
       "with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the\n",
       "daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most\n",
       "prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for\n",
       "the time, who never had been able to understand what she meant by a\n",
       "basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.  Often as she had\n",

       "at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\n",
       "that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\n",

       "most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.  She\n",
       "had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met\n",
       "by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked\n",
       "on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--of whom he, on\n",
       "the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he\n",

       "great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.  But, upon my word, Mr.\n",

       "me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice\n",

       "to-night.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\n",

       "care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,\n",
       "he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but\n",

       "hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well\n",
       "satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being \"very cold,\n",

       "\"Well,\" said she to herself, \"this is most strange!--After I had got\n",

       "behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,\n",
       "especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining\n",
       "out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\n",
       "their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing\n",
       "gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\n",
       "valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in\n",
       "love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must\n",
       "dine out wherever he is asked.  What a strange thing love is! he can\n",

       "\n",
       "Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\n",

       "approbation much in his favour.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley\n",
       "began with--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\n",
       "Elton.  It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.  With\n",
       "men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\n",
       "please, every feature works.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\n",
       "is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a\n",
       "great deal.  Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\n",
       "will have the advantage over negligent superiority.  There is such\n",
       "perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \"he seems\n",
       "to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining me\n",
       "to be Mr. Elton's object?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\n",
       "occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\n",
       "so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.  I think your\n",
       "manners to him encouraging.  I speak as a friend, Emma.  You had better\n",
       "look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.  Mr. Elton and I\n",
       "are very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on, amusing\n",
       "herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\n",
       "partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\n",
       "high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\n",
       "well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\n",
       "in want of counsel.  He said no more.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\n",
       "spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\n",
       "shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\n",
       "eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\n",
       "of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\n",
       "own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\n",
       "was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.  The cold, however, was\n",
       "severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\n",
       "of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\n",
       "being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\n",
       "white world in a very short time.\n",
       "\n",

       "preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\n",

       "which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\n",
       "nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\n",
       "whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\n",
       "discontent.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when he\n",

       "this, for the sake of coming to see him.  He must think himself a most\n",
       "agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing.  It is the greatest\n",

       "should deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\n",
       "than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\n",
       "the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\n",
       "or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\n",
       "that he can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\n",
       "another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\n",

       "love,\" which must have been usually administered by his travelling\n",
       "companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any\n",
       "answer at all.  She could not be complying, she dreaded being\n",
       "quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence.  She allowed him to\n",

       "obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities\n",
       "indeed, that she began to think he must have received a different\n",

       "\n",
       "\"_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard's,\" said she presently, \"was not so\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\n",
       "when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing\n",
       "before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\n",
       "by no means better, rather worse.  Very much grieved and concerned-- I\n",
       "had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I\n",
       "knew had been given her in the morning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma smiled and answered--\"My visit was of use to the nervous part of\n",
       "her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it\n",
       "is a most severe cold indeed.  Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\n",
       "morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.  But it is\n",
       "impossible not to feel uneasiness.  Such a sad loss to our party\n",
       "to-day!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\n",
       "estimable; but it should have lasted longer.  Emma was rather in dismay\n",
       "when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\n",
       "and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin for\n",
       "carriages.  How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold\n",
       "with such precautions.  The contrivances of modern days indeed have\n",
       "rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete.  One is so fenced\n",
       "and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\n",
       "unpermitted.  Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence.  It is a\n",

       "have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\n",
       "much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.  This is\n",
       "quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.  At Christmas every body\n",
       "invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\n",
       "worst weather.  I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week.\n",
       "Nothing could be pleasanter.  I went for only one night, and could not\n",
       "get away till that very day se'nnight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\n",

       "\n",
       "At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\n",
       "astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.  Harriet\n",
       "seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\n",
       "\n",

       "indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\n",
       "hospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but\n",
       "where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of\n",
       "any.  Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten\n",
       "comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances,\n",
       "fall short by two than exceed by two.  I think you will agree with me,\n",

       "\n",
       "Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\n",
       "walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his\n",
       "joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr. Elton\n",
       "must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\n",
       "place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\n",
       "happy as she was.  To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\n",
       "Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\n",
       "world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\n",
       "one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\n",
       "understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\n",
       "little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\n",
       "and herself.  She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\n",
       "had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted\n",
       "communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness\n",
       "of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not\n",
       "afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but\n",
       "the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was\n",
       "grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of\n",
       "Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all\n",
       "that was enjoyable to the utmost.\n",
       "\n",
       "The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through\n",
       "before her arrival.  Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough\n",
       "to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\n",
       "Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just\n",
       "got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\n",
       "daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been\n",
       "almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away\n",
       "and welcome her dear Emma.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather\n",
       "sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close\n",
       "to her.  The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility\n",
       "towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\n",
       "was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\n",
       "solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.  Instead of forgetting\n",
       "him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\n",
       "suggestion of \"Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\n",
       "possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\n",
       "Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\"-- Yet he would be so anxious\n",
       "for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,\n",
       "and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\n",
       "drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\n",
       "like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\n",
       "good manners.  For her own sake she could not be rude; and for\n",
       "Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even\n",
       "positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was\n",
       "going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr.\n",
       "Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to.  She\n",
       "heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about\n",
       "his son; she heard the words \"my son,\" and \"Frank,\" and \"my son,\"\n",
       "repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very\n",
       "much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but\n",
       "before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past\n",
       "that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never\n",
       "marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank\n",
       "Churchill, which always interested her.  She had frequently\n",
       "thought--especially since his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that\n",
       "if she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\n",
       "character and condition.  He seemed by this connexion between the\n",
       "families, quite to belong to her.  She could not but suppose it to be a\n",
       "match that every body who knew them must think of.  That Mr. and Mrs.\n",
       "Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not\n",
       "meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\n",
       "situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\n",
       "change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided\n",
       "intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain\n",
       "degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in\n",
       "their friends' imaginations.\n",
       "\n",
       "With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\n",
       "but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\n",
       "cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\n",
       "pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\n",
       "substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for\n",
       "when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at\n",
       "dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\n",
       "hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say\n",
       "to her,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We want only two more to be just the right number.  I should like to\n",
       "see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my\n",
       "son--and then I should say we were quite complete.  I believe you did\n",
       "not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are\n",
       "expecting Frank.  I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be\n",
       "with us within a fortnight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\n",
       "his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their\n",
       "party quite complete.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He has been wanting to come to us,\" continued Mr. Weston, \"ever since\n",
       "September:  every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\n",
       "own time.  He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\n",
       "ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\n",
       "But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\n",
       "January.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\n",
       "anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\n",
       "yourself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\n",
       "She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\n",
       "know the parties so well as I do.  The case, you see, is--(but this is\n",
       "quite between ourselves:  I did not mention a syllable of it in the\n",
       "other room.  There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case is,\n",
       "that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in\n",
       "January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off.  If\n",
       "they are not put off, he cannot stir.  But I know they will, because it\n",
       "is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\n",
       "a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\n",
       "them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\n",
       "to the point.  I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.  I am as\n",
       "confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of\n",
       "being here myself:  but your good friend there (nodding towards the\n",
       "upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so\n",
       "little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their\n",
       "effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\" replied\n",
       "Emma; \"but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.  If you think he\n",
       "will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\n",
       "the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself\n",
       "to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe her to be\n",
       "very fond of him.  I used to think she was not capable of being fond of\n",
       "any body, except herself:  but she has always been kind to him (in her\n",
       "way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\n",
       "to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\n",
       "that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it\n",
       "to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\n",
       "general; and the devil of a temper.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\n",
       "very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her\n",
       "joy--yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather\n",
       "alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be\n",
       "very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at\n",
       "the time talked of:  \"for I cannot depend upon his coming.  I cannot be\n",
       "so sanguine as Mr. Weston.  I am very much afraid that it will all end\n",
       "in nothing.  Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how\n",
       "the matter stands?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\n",
       "Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My Emma!\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty of\n",
       "caprice?\"  Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\n",
       "before--\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\n",
       "so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\n",
       "thinks.  It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in\n",
       "short, upon her temper.  To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on\n",
       "the truth.  Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very\n",
       "odd-tempered woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing\n",
       "to spare him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\" replied\n",
       "Isabella:  \"and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without\n",
       "the greatest compassion.  To be constantly living with an ill-tempered\n",
       "person, must be dreadful.  It is what we happily have never known any\n",
       "thing of; but it must be a life of misery.  What a blessing, that she\n",
       "never had any children!  Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would\n",
       "have made them!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.  She should then have\n",
       "heard more:  Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\n",
       "which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\n",
       "would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from\n",
       "her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\n",
       "imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.  But at\n",
       "present there was nothing more to be said.  Mr. Woodhouse very soon\n",
       "followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,\n",
       "was a confinement that he could not endure.  Neither wine nor\n",
       "conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\n",
       "whom he was always comfortable.\n",
       "\n",
       "While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\n",
       "saying,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\n",
       "certain.  I am sorry for it.  The introduction must be unpleasant,\n",
       "whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.\n",
       "Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid\n",
       "that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.  I cannot bear to\n",
       "imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish\n",
       "on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves.  There is jealousy.  They\n",
       "are jealous even of his regard for his father.  In short, I can feel no\n",
       "dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He ought to come,\" said Emma.  \"If he could stay only a couple of\n",
       "days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not\n",
       "having it in his power to do as much as that.  A young _woman_, if she\n",
       "fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance from those\n",
       "she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being\n",
       "under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his\n",
       "father, if he likes it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\n",
       "one decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston.  \"One ought to\n",
       "use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\n",
       "individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\n",
       "not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\n",
       "every thing gives way to her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But she is so fond of the nephew:  he is so very great a favourite.\n",
       "Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\n",
       "that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\n",
       "whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\n",
       "towards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom\n",
       "she owes nothing at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\n",
       "a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:  you must let it go its own\n",
       "way.  I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence;\n",
       "but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it\n",
       "will be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied, unless\n",

       "little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\n",
       "have always set him the example of it.  It is a great deal more natural\n",
       "than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\n",
       "proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\n",
       "too.  If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\n",
       "contrived it between September and January.  A man at his age--what is\n",
       "he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\n",
       "own master.  You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of\n",
       "the difficulties of dependence.  You do not know what it is to have\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\n",

       "money--he cannot want leisure.  We know, on the contrary, that he has\n",
       "so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest\n",
       "haunts in the kingdom.  We hear of him for ever at some watering-place\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate\n",
       "knowledge of their situation.  Nobody, who has not been in the interior\n",

       "To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\n",

       "of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.  I can allow\n",
       "for the fears of the child, but not of the man.  As he became rational,\n",
       "he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\n",

       "himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\n",

       "account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\n",
       "feel the omission.  Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\n",
       "would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\n",
       "did or no.  Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\n",

       "bargain.  Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\n",
       "coming will produce?  There will be but one subject throughout the\n",
       "parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object of\n",

       "music; and so on to every body, having that general information on all\n",
       "subjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,\n",
       "just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\n",
       "that is my idea of him.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his own\n",
       "superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make\n",

       "their scanty comforts.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\n",

       "all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate\n",
       "and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and\n",
       "therefore she seldom went near them.  But now she made the sudden\n",

       "cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who\n",
       "with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to\n",
       "give up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking\n",

       "he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he\n",

       "being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very\n",
       "lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.  I was reading\n",
       "it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my\n",
       "mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--a letter from Jane--that she\n",

       "here it is, only just under my huswife--and since you are so kind as to\n",
       "wish to hear what she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in\n",
       "justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two\n",
       "pages you see--hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper\n",
       "and crosses half.  My mother often wonders that I can make it out so\n",
       "well.  She often says, when the letter is first opened, 'Well, Hetty,\n",
       "now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--\n",
       "don't you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to\n",

       "It is such a blessing!  My mother's are really very good indeed.  Jane\n",

       "The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry, and\n",

       "interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\n",
       "remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking under\n",
       "consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\n",
       "\n",
       "By birth she belonged to Highbury:  and when at three years old, on\n",

       "consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed\n",

       "taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with\n",
       "no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\n",
       "nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\n",
       "warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\n",
       "\n",
       "But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\n",
       "to her destiny.  This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly\n",
       "regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man;\n",
       "and farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a\n",
       "severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life.  These were\n",
       "claims which he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed\n",
       "away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England\n",
       "put any thing in his power.  When he did return, he sought out the\n",
       "child and took notice of her.  He was a married man, with only one\n",
       "living child, a girl, about Jane's age:  and Jane became their guest,\n",
       "paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before\n",
       "she was nine years old, his daughter's great fondness for her, and his\n",
       "own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from\n",
       "Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education.  It\n",
       "was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel\n",
       "Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her\n",
       "grandmother from time to time.\n",
       "\n",
       "The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\n",
       "very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\n",
       "independence impossible.  To provide for her otherwise was out of\n",
       "Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay and\n",
       "appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all\n",
       "his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be\n",
       "supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.\n",
       "\n",
       "Such was Jane Fairfax's history.  She had fallen into good hands, known\n",
       "nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\n",
       "education.  Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed\n",
       "people, her heart and understanding had received every advantage of\n",
       "discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in\n",
       "London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the\n",
       "attendance of first-rate masters.  Her disposition and abilities were\n",
       "equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or\n",
       "nineteen she was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the\n",
       "care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself;\n",
       "but she was too much beloved to be parted with.  Neither father nor\n",
       "mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it.  The evil\n",
       "day was put off.  It was easy to decide that she was still too young;\n",
       "and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the\n",
       "rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of\n",
       "home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering\n",

       "might soon be over.\n",
       "\n",
       "The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell\n",

       "acquirements.  That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\n",
       "by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by\n",

       "to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the\n",
       "affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as\n",
       "soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled,\n",
       "while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.\n",

       "This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\n",
       "yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\n",
       "of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\n",
       "fixed on for beginning.  She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\n",
       "should be the period.  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she\n",
       "had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire\n",

       "\n",
       "The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a\n",
       "resolution, though their feelings did.  As long as they lived, no\n",
       "exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and\n",
       "for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this\n",
       "would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon.\n",

       "resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of\n",
       "such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished.\n",
       "Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse\n",
       "for not hurrying on the wretched moment.  She had never been quite well\n",
       "since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she should have\n",
       "completely recovered her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging\n",
       "in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame\n",
       "and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances,\n",
       "to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be\n",

       "With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\n",

       "those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\n",
       "whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double,\n",

       "and less than she ought!  Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\n",
       "difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\n",
       "because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\n",
       "wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been\n",
       "eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in\n",
       "which her conscience could not quite acquit her.  But \"she could never\n",
       "get acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was\n",
       "such coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she\n",
       "pleased or not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she\n",
       "was made such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always\n",
       "imagined that they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the\n",
       "same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.\"\n",
       "These were her reasons--she had no better.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\n",
       "by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\n",
       "considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\n",
       "now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'\n",
       "interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\n",
       "manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.\n",
       "Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself\n",
       "the highest value for elegance.  Her height was pretty, just such as\n",
       "almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall;\n",
       "her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium,\n",
       "between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed\n",
       "to point out the likeliest evil of the two.  Emma could not but feel\n",
       "all this; and then, her face--her features--there was more beauty in\n",
       "them altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was\n",
       "very pleasing beauty.  Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and\n",
       "eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she\n",
       "had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and\n",
       "delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom.  It was a style of\n",
       "beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she\n",
       "must, in honour, by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which,\n",
       "whether of person or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.  There,\n",
       "not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.\n",
       "\n",
       "In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\n",
       "twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\n",
       "justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer.\n",
       "When she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her\n",
       "beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to,\n",
       "what she was going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed\n",
       "impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if\n",
       "to every well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added\n",
       "the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which\n",
       "she had so naturally started to herself.  In that case, nothing could\n",
       "be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had\n",
       "resolved on.  Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\n",
       "Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which\n",
       "her imagination had suggested at first.  If it were love, it might be\n",
       "simple, single, successless love on her side alone.  She might have\n",
       "been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his\n",
       "conversation with her friend; and from the best, the purest of motives,\n",
       "might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to\n",
       "divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon\n",
       "beginning her career of laborious duty.\n",
       "\n",
       "Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\n",
       "as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\n",
       "afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that\n",
       "she could wish to scheme about for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "These were charming feelings--but not lasting.  Before she had\n",
       "committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\n",
       "Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and\n",
       "errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, \"She certainly is handsome; she\n",
       "is better than handsome!\"  Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with\n",
       "her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its\n",
       "usual state.  Former provocations reappeared.  The aunt was as tiresome\n",
       "as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to\n",
       "admiration of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of\n",
       "exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how\n",
       "small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of\n",
       "new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane's\n",
       "offences rose again.  They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the\n",
       "thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an\n",
       "affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off\n",
       "in higher style her own very superior performance.  She was, besides,\n",
       "which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious!  There was no getting\n",
       "at her real opinion.  Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed\n",
       "determined to hazard nothing.  She was disgustingly, was suspiciously\n",
       "reserved.\n",
       "\n",
       "If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved\n",
       "on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.  She seemed\n",
       "bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her own\n",
       "value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match.  It\n",
       "was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or\n",
       "distinguished.  It did her no service however.  Her caution was thrown\n",
       "away.  Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her first surmises.\n",
       "There probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference;\n",
       "Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the\n",
       "other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future\n",
       "twelve thousand pounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "The like reserve prevailed on other topics.  She and Mr. Frank\n",
       "Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time.  It was known that\n",
       "they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information\n",
       "could Emma procure as to what he truly was.  \"Was he handsome?\"--\"She\n",
       "believed he was reckoned a very fine young man.\"  \"Was he agreeable?\"--\n",
       "\"He was generally thought so.\"  \"Did he appear a sensible young man; a\n",
       "young man of information?\"--\"At a watering-place, or in a common London\n",
       "acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.  Manners were\n",
       "all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\n",
       "they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.  She believed every body found his\n",

       "\n",
       "Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\n",
       "were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\n",
       "seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\n",
       "expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\n",
       "Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\n",
       "have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain\n",
       "enough to be very intelligible to Emma.  He had been used to think her\n",
       "unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A very pleasant evening,\" he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\n",
       "talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\n",
       "swept away;--\"particularly pleasant.  You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\n",
       "very good music.  I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than\n",
       "sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such\n",
       "young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation.  I\n",
       "am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma.  You\n",
       "left nothing undone.  I was glad you made her play so much, for having\n",
       "no instrument at her grandmother's, it must have been a real\n",
       "indulgence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am happy you approved,\" said Emma, smiling; \"but I hope I am not\n",
       "often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, my dear,\" said her father instantly; \"_that_ I am sure you are\n",
       "not.  There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.  If any\n",
       "thing, you are too attentive.  The muffin last night--if it had been\n",
       "handed round once, I think it would have been enough.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \"you are not often\n",
       "deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.  I\n",
       "think you understand me, therefore.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "An arch look expressed--\"I understand you well enough;\" but she said\n",
       "only, \"Miss Fairfax is reserved.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all\n",
       "that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\n",
       "foundation in diffidence.  What arises from discretion must be\n",
       "honoured.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You think her diffident.  I do not see it.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "evening.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;\n",
       "and amused to think how little information I obtained.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am disappointed,\" was his only answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope every body had a pleasant evening,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\n",
       "quiet way.  \"I had.  Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\n",
       "moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\n",
       "Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\n",
       "she speaks rather too quick.  However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\n",
       "Bates too, in a different way.  I like old friends; and Miss Jane\n",
       "Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very\n",
       "well-behaved young lady indeed.  She must have found the evening\n",
       "agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes\n",
       "from.  I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my\n",
       "heart.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\n",
       "express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\n",
       "thoughts were on the Bates's, said--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!  a\n",
       "great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one can\n",
       "venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon-- Now we\n",
       "have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\n",
       "it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other\n",
       "pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\n",
       "of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried,\n",
       "without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear\n",
       "roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so,\n",
       "my dear?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\n",
       "There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,\n",
       "and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's right, my dear, very right.  I had not thought of it before,\n",
       "but that is the best way.  They must not over-salt the leg; and then,\n",
       "if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as\n",
       "Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip,\n",
       "and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley presently, \"I have a piece of news for you.\n",
       "You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think\n",
       "will interest you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"News!  Oh! yes, I always like news.  What is it?--why do you smile\n",
       "so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He had time only to say,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\" when the door was\n",
       "thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.\n",
       "Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give\n",
       "quickest.  Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that\n",
       "not another syllable of communication could rest with him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?  My dear Miss Woodhouse-- I\n",
       "come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!  You\n",
       "are too bountiful!  Have you heard the news?  Mr. Elton is going to be\n",
       "married.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\n",
       "completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\n",
       "little blush, at the sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\" said Mr.\n",
       "Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\n",
       "had passed between them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But where could _you_ hear it?\" cried Miss Bates.  \"Where could you\n",
       "possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?  For it is not five minutes since I\n",
       "received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at\n",
       "least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come\n",
       "out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane\n",
       "was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was so\n",
       "afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough.  So I said I would\n",
       "go down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I think\n",
       "you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--'Oh!\n",
       "my dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note.  A Miss Hawkins--\n",
       "that's all I know.  A Miss Hawkins of Bath.  But, Mr. Knightley, how\n",
       "could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told\n",
       "Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me.  A Miss Hawkins--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.  He had just\n",
       "read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\n",
       "generally interesting.  My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.  My\n",
       "mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\n",
       "thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We consider our Hartfield pork,\" replied Mr. Woodhouse--\"indeed it\n",
       "certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I\n",
       "cannot have a greater pleasure than--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to\n",
       "us.  If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\n",
       "themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\n",
       "We may well say that 'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.' Well, Mr.\n",
       "Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of\n",
       "course.\"-- Here was a sly glance at Emma.  \"He had been so fortunate as\n",
       "to--I forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.\n",
       "The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a\n",
       "Miss Hawkins.  By his style, I should imagine it just settled.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Elton going to be married!\" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\n",
       "\"He will have every body's wishes for his happiness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is very young to settle,\" was Mr. Woodhouse's observation.  \"He had\n",
       "better not be in a hurry.  He seemed to me very well off as he was.  We\n",
       "were always glad to see him at Hartfield.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\" said Miss Bates,\n",
       "joyfully; \"my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot bear to have\n",
       "the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.  This is great news, indeed.\n",
       "Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a\n",
       "curiosity to see him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\n",
       "occupy her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\" she replied, starting on this\n",
       "appeal; \"is he--is he a tall man?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who shall answer that question?\" cried Emma.  \"My father would say\n",
       "'yes,' Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\n",
       "happy medium.  When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\n",
       "you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\n",
       "Highbury, both in person and mind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will.  He is the very best young\n",
       "man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he was\n",
       "precisely the height of Mr. Perry.  Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, an\n",
       "excellent young woman.  His extreme attention to my mother--wanting\n",
       "her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\n",
       "mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she does not\n",
       "hear quite quick.  Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf.\n",
       "He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she says\n",
       "it did him no lasting benefit.  Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite\n",
       "our angel.  And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy\n",
       "of him.  It is such a happiness when good people get together--and they\n",
       "always do.  Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are\n",
       "the Coles, such very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there never\n",
       "was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry.  I say, sir,\"\n",
       "turning to Mr. Woodhouse, \"I think there are few places with such\n",
       "society as Highbury.  I always say, we are quite blessed in our\n",
       "neighbours.--My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better\n",
       "than another, it is pork--a roast loin of pork--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\n",
       "with her,\" said Emma, \"nothing I suppose can be known.  One feels that\n",
       "it cannot be a very long acquaintance.  He has been gone only four\n",
       "weeks.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\n",
       "Emma said,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take an interest\n",
       "in this news.  You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on\n",
       "these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\n",
       "Campbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about\n",
       "Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I have seen Mr. Elton,\" replied Jane, \"I dare say I shall be\n",
       "interested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me.  And as it is\n",
       "some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little\n",
       "worn off.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse,\" said Miss Bates, \"four weeks yesterday.--A Miss\n",
       "Hawkins!--Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady\n",
       "hereabouts; not that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I\n",
       "immediately said, 'No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--In\n",
       "short, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of\n",
       "discoveries.  I do not pretend to it.  What is before me, I see.  At\n",
       "the same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have\n",
       "aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She\n",
       "knows I would not offend for the world.  How does Miss Smith do?  She\n",
       "seems quite recovered now.  Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley\n",
       "lately?  Oh! those dear little children.  Jane, do you know I always\n",
       "fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley.  I mean in person--tall, and\n",
       "with that sort of look--and not very talkative.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\n",
       "One takes up a notion, and runs away with it.  Mr. Dixon, you say, is\n",
       "not, strictly speaking, handsome?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Handsome!  Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain.  I told you he was\n",
       "plain.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\n",
       "and that you yourself--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.  Where I have a regard, I\n",
       "always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\n",
       "general opinion, when I called him plain.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\n",
       "her seemingly with ceremonious civility.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.  She was\n",
       "feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\n",
       "understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\n",
       "She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.  They had received her\n",
       "doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace\n",
       "had been talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs.\n",
       "Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was\n",
       "grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.\n",
       "In that very room she had been measured last September, with her two\n",
       "friends.  There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the\n",
       "wainscot by the window.  _He_ had done it.  They all seemed to remember\n",
       "the day, the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same\n",
       "consciousness, the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good\n",
       "understanding; and they were just growing again like themselves,\n",
       "(Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be\n",
       "cordial and happy,) when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.\n",
       "The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be\n",
       "decisive.  Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had\n",
       "thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but\n",
       "picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally\n",
       "Harriet must suffer.  It was a bad business.  She would have given a\n",
       "great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a\n",
       "higher rank of life.  They were so deserving, that a _little_ higher\n",
       "should have been enough:  but as it was, how could she have done\n",
       "otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent.  They must be separated;\n",
       "but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much to herself\n",
       "at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation,\n",
       "and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it.  Her mind\n",
       "was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins.  The refreshment of\n",
       "Randalls was absolutely necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that\n",
       "neither \"master nor mistress was at home;\" they had both been out some\n",
       "time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is too bad,\" cried Emma, as they turned away.  \"And now we shall\n",
       "just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so\n",
       "disappointed.\"  And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\n",
       "murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being\n",
       "the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.  Presently the\n",
       "carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who\n",
       "were standing to speak to her.  There was instant pleasure in the sight\n",
       "of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr.\n",
       "Weston immediately accosted her with,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--\n",
       "glad to see him so well.  Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this\n",
       "morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he is at\n",
       "Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\n",
       "so.  If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\n",
       "was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\n",
       "just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather.  We shall\n",
       "enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\n",
       "wish.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\n",
       "influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was\n",
       "by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but\n",
       "not less to the purpose.  To know that _she_ thought his coming certain\n",
       "was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice\n",
       "in their joy.  It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted\n",
       "spirits.  The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was\n",
       "coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr.\n",
       "Elton would now be talked of no more.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\n",
       "allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his\n",
       "command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she\n",
       "listened, and smiled, and congratulated.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\" said he, at the conclusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\n",
       "wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We had better move on, Mr. Weston,\" said she, \"we are detaining the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, well, I am ready;\"--and turning again to Emma, \"but you must not\n",
       "be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only had _my_\n",
       "account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:\"--though\n",
       "his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very\n",
       "different conviction.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\n",
       "manner that appropriated nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,\" was Mrs.\n",

       "for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\" was Mr.\n",
       "Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\n",
       "Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a\n",
       "different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\n",
       "before.  When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\n",
       "must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\n",
       "something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\n",

       "question, however, which did not augur much.\n",
       "\n",
       "But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\n",
       "was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\n",
       "\n",
       "The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful\n",
       "pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that\n",

       "\n",

       "minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of\n",
       "Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the\n",
       "midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared,\n",
       "to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was\n",
       "actually before her--he was presented to her, and she did not think too\n",
       "much had been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young\n",
       "man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his\n",
       "countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his\n",
       "father's; he looked quick and sensible.  She felt immediately that she\n",
       "should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a\n",
       "readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be\n",
       "acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had reached Randalls the evening before.  She was pleased with the\n",
       "eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\n",
       "earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I told you yesterday,\" cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \"I told you\n",

       "used to do myself.  One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\n",
       "getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\n",
       "upon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\n",
       "more than any little exertion it needs.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\n",
       "Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\n",
       "conviction was strengthened by what followed.  He was very much pleased\n",
       "with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\n",
       "allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\n",
       "Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\n",
       "to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\n",
       "one's _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it.\n",
       "That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling\n",
       "before, passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were\n",
       "a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled.  His manner\n",
       "had no air of study or exaggeration.  He did really look and speak as\n",
       "if in a state of no common enjoyment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\n",

       "neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were\n",

       "\n",
       "But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\n",

       "their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\n",
       "mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so\n",
       "much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured\n",
       "to his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an\n",
       "additional proof of his knowing how to please--and of his certainly\n",
       "thinking it worth while to try to please her.  He did not advance a\n",
       "word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs.\n",
       "Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter.  He\n",
       "understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else.\n",
       "\"His father's marriage,\" he said, \"had been the wisest measure, every\n",
       "friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received\n",
       "such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest\n",
       "obligation on him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,\n",
       "without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\n",
       "was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's\n",
       "character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if\n",
       "resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\n",

       "her person.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\" said he; \"but I\n",
       "confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\n",
       "very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\n",
       "I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\"\n",
       "said Emma; \"were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen\n",
       "with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using\n",
       "such words.  Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a\n",
       "pretty young woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope I should know better,\" he replied; \"no, depend upon it, (with a\n",

       "Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\n",
       "their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her\n",
       "mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be\n",
       "considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.  She must\n",
       "see more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they\n",
       "were agreeable.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.  His\n",
       "quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a\n",
       "happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look,\n",
       "she was confident that he was often listening.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\n",
       "entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\n",
       "was a most comfortable circumstance.  Happily he was not farther from\n",
       "approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.-- Though always objecting\n",
       "to every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from\n",
       "the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of\n",
       "any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till\n",
       "it were proved against them.  She blessed the favouring blindness.  He\n",
       "could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without\n",
       "a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to\n",
       "all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\n",
       "Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\n",
       "of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\n",
       "anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,\n",
       "however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\n",
       "after another night.\n",

       "A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\"He must be going.\n",
       "He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands\n",
       "for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else.\" His\n",

       "\n",
       "\"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\n",
       "of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\n",

       "Highbury, would be his constant attraction.\"-- Highbury, with Mrs.\n",
       "Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same\n",

       "half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\n",
       "nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\n",
       "therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\n",
       "arm.  She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\n",
       "company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\n",

       "for it.  But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied.\n",
       "It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid\n",
       "his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole\n",
       "manner to her--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of\n",
       "considering her as a friend and securing her affection.  And there was\n",
       "time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit\n",
       "included all the rest of the morning.  They were all three walking\n",
       "about together for an hour or two--first round the shrubberies of\n",
       "Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.  He was delighted with every\n",
       "thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when\n",
       "their going farther was resolved on, confessed his wish to be made\n",
       "acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and\n",
       "interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.  He\n",
       "begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\n",
       "which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting\n",
       "that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest\n",
       "of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\n",
       "some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\n",
       "shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\n",
       "be very like a merit to those he was with.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\n",
       "could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\n",
       "absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a\n",
       "parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had\n",
       "not done him justice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\n",
       "the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\n",
       "were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\n",
       "run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\n",
       "any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\n",
       "the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a\n",
       "ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\n",
       "populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such\n",
       "brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\n",
       "which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\n",
       "among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.  He was\n",
       "immediately interested.  Its character as a ball-room caught him; and\n",
       "instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior\n",
       "sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its\n",
       "capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased.\n",
       "He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge none which they\n",
       "suggested.  No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough.  It\n",
       "would hold the very number for comfort.  They ought to have balls there\n",
       "at least every fortnight through the winter.  Why had not Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She who could\n",
       "do any thing in Highbury!  The want of proper families in the place,\n",
       "and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate\n",
       "environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not\n",
       "satisfied.  He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses\n",
       "as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a\n",
       "meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described,\n",
       "he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a\n",
       "mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest\n",
       "difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next\n",
       "morning.  He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and\n",
       "Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail\n",
       "so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.  He seemed to have\n",
       "all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of\n",
       "his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.  Of pride,\n",
       "indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a\n",
       "confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.  He could\n",
       "be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.  It was but an\n",
       "effusion of lively spirits.\n",
       "\n",
       "At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and\n",
       "being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\n",
       "recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\n",
       "paid it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, oh! yes\"--he replied; \"I was just going to mention it.  A very\n",
       "successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\n",
       "obliged to you for your preparatory hint.  If the talking aunt had\n",
       "taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.  As it\n",
       "was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.  Ten\n",
       "minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was\n",
       "proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before\n",
       "him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter\n",
       "astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me\n",
       "there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly\n",
       "three-quarters of an hour.  The good lady had not given me the\n",
       "possibility of escape before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "ill.  But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?\n",
       "Ladies can never look ill.  And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally\n",
       "so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.-- A\n",
       "most deplorable want of complexion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss\n",
       "Fairfax's complexion.  \"It was certainly never brilliant, but she would\n",
       "not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness\n",
       "and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character\n",
       "of her face.\"  He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he\n",
       "had heard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that to\n",
       "him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.\n",
       "Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them\n",
       "all; and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not\n",
       "attempt to describe what the effect was.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Emma, \"there is no disputing about taste.--At least you\n",

       "their lives, as my father informs me.  He comes to Highbury himself, he\n",
       "says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.  If\n",
       "it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\n",
       "myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.  I\n",
       "must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.-- I\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.  I do admire your patriotism.  You\n",

       "her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\n",
       "reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\n",

       "\n",
       "\"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\n",

       "\n",

       "excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of\n",
       "judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her's\n",
       "admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a\n",
       "man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to\n",
       "her--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman to\n",
       "sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\n",
       "instead--never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\n",

       "not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\n",
       "always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!-- Poor\n",
       "Mrs. Dixon!  Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\"\n",

       "dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt\n",
       "it:  Miss Fairfax herself.  She must have felt the improper and\n",

       "all be behind the scenes.  I can only say that there was smoothness\n",
       "outwardly.  But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be\n",

       "made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who\n",
       "smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them\n",
       "not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr.\n",
       "Knightley.  The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment,\n",

       "himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, \"Hum! just the trifling,\n",
       "silly fellow I took him for.\"  She had half a mind to resent; but an\n",
       "instant's observation convinced her that it was really said only to\n",
       "relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she\n",

       "Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs.\n",

       "\n",
       "This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in\n",
       "Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and\n",
       "unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in\n",
       "trade, and only moderately genteel.  On their first coming into the\n",
       "country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping\n",
       "little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two\n",
       "had brought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town\n",
       "had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.\n",
       "With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house,\n",
       "their inclination for more company.  They added to their house, to\n",
       "their number of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this\n",
       "time were, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at\n",

       "every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly\n",
       "among the single men, had already taken place.  The regular and best\n",
       "families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--\n",
       "neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls.  Nothing should tempt\n",
       "_her_ to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's known\n",
       "habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish.\n",
       "The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they ought to be\n",
       "taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the\n",
       "superior families would visit them.  This lesson, she very much feared,\n",
       "they would receive only from herself; she had little hope of Mr.\n",
       "Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\n",
       "\n",
       "But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\n",
       "before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\n",
       "very differently affected.  Donwell and Randalls had received their\n",
       "invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\n",
       "Weston's accounting for it with \"I suppose they will not take the\n",
       "liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,\" was not quite\n",
       "sufficient.  She felt that she should like to have had the power of\n",
       "refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled\n",
       "there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her,\n",

       "the day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her\n",
       "absence.  Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of\n",
       "his.  The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her\n",
       "spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the\n",
       "omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\n",
       "Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her\n",
       "first remark, on reading it, was that \"of course it must be declined,\"\n",
       "she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,\n",
       "that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\n",
       "\n",
       "She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without\n",
       "inclination for the party.  The Coles expressed themselves so\n",
       "properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so\n",
       "much consideration for her father.  \"They would have solicited the\n",
       "honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen\n",
       "from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught\n",
       "of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the\n",
       "honour of his company.\"  Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and\n",
       "it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without\n",
       "neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates,\n",
       "might be depended on for bearing him company-- Mr. Woodhouse was to be\n",
       "talked into an acquiescence of his daughter's going out to dinner on a\n",
       "day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him.  As\n",
       "for _his_ going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours\n",
       "would be too late, and the party too numerous.  He was soon pretty well\n",

       "in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, sir,\" cried Mr. Weston, \"as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\n",

       "\n",
       "But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not\n",

       "\n",
       "With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\n",

       "that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\n",

       "either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the\n",
       "misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a\n",

       "you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\n",
       "paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\n",
       "But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that\n",

       "it in no other light than as an offering of love.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There was no occasion to press the matter farther.  The conviction\n",

       "dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired\n",
       "amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few\n",
       "downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor\n",

       "dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\n",
       "the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\n",
       "cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\n",

       "\n",
       "In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\n",
       "She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\n",
       "secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\n",
       "and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\n",

       "to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\n",

       "They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of\n",
       "the early was Frank Churchill.  In he walked, the first and the\n",
       "handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\n",
       "and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the\n",
       "circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,\n",
       "would not sit at all.  Emma divined what every body present must be\n",
       "thinking.  She was his object, and every body must perceive it.  She\n",
       "introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments\n",
       "afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.  \"He had never seen\n",
       "so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete.\" And she, \"Only\n",
       "to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment, but she did think\n",
       "there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.\" Emma restrained her\n",
       "indignation, and only turned from her in silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\n",
       "glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\n",
       "He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated\n",
       "sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--that his\n",
       "father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\n",
       "parish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\n",
       "pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of\n",
       "gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury\n",
       "altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--that Emma\n",
       "began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much.\n",
       "She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--the extent of the\n",
       "neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his\n",
       "answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little\n",
       "going on, that their visitings were among a range of great families,\n",
       "none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations\n",
       "accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health\n",
       "and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh\n",
       "person; and that, though he had his separate engagements, it was not\n",
       "without difficulty, without considerable address _at_ _times_, that he\n",
       "could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.\n",
       "\n",
       "She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\n",
       "its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement\n",
       "at home than he liked.  His importance at Enscombe was very evident.\n",
       "He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had\n",
       "persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her\n",
       "laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or\n",
       "two points) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing.  One of\n",
       "those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.  He had\n",
       "wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed\n",
       "to travel--but she would not hear of it.  This had happened the year\n",
       "before.  _Now_, he said, he was beginning to have no longer the same\n",
       "wish.\n",
       "\n",
       "The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\n",
       "good behaviour to his father.\n",

       "pause.-- \"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.  I never\n",
       "knew days fly so fast.  A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to\n",

       "I hate the recollection.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "of so few, in having your hair cut.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said he, smiling, \"that is no subject of regret at all.  I have\n",

       "When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as\n",
       "before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at\n",
       "Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is the matter?\" said she.\n",
       "\n",
       "He started.  \"Thank you for rousing me,\" he replied.  \"I believe I have\n",
       "been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\n",
       "way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her.  I never\n",
       "saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her\n",
       "own.  I see nobody else looking like her!-- I must go and ask her\n",
       "whether it is an Irish fashion.  Shall I?-- Yes, I will--I declare I\n",
       "will--and you shall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\n",
       "Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as\n",
       "he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\n",
       "front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is the luxury of a large party,\" said she:--\"one can get near\n",
       "every body, and say every thing.  My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to\n",
       "you.  I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\n",
       "yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.  Do you know\n",
       "how Miss Bates and her niece came here?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How?--They were invited, were not they?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their\n",
       "coming?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They walked, I conclude.  How else could they come?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it\n",
       "would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\n",
       "cold as the nights are now.  And as I looked at her, though I never saw\n",
       "her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\n",
       "would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.  Poor girl!  I\n",
       "could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the\n",
       "room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage.  You\n",
       "may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his\n",
       "approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that\n",
       "the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for I\n",
       "thought it would be making her comfortable at once.  Good soul! she was\n",
       "as grateful as possible, you may be sure.  'Nobody was ever so\n",
       "fortunate as herself!'--but with many, many thanks--'there was no\n",
       "occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought, and\n",
       "was to take them home again.'  I was quite surprized;--very glad, I am\n",
       "sure; but really quite surprized.  Such a very kind attention--and so\n",
       "thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing that so few men would\n",
       "think of.  And, in short, from knowing his usual ways, I am very much\n",
       "inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was\n",
       "used at all.  I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for\n",
       "himself, and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very likely,\" said Emma--\"nothing more likely.  I know no man more\n",
       "likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing\n",
       "really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.  He is not a\n",
       "gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\n",
       "Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for\n",
       "an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\n",
       "more than on Mr. Knightley.  I know he had horses to-day--for we\n",
       "arrived together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word\n",
       "that could betray.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"you give him credit for more\n",
       "simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while\n",
       "Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have\n",
       "never been able to get it out again.  The more I think of it, the more\n",
       "probable it appears.  In short, I have made a match between Mr.\n",
       "Knightley and Jane Fairfax.  See the consequence of keeping you\n",
       "company!--What do you say to it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\" exclaimed Emma.  \"Dear Mrs. Weston,\n",
       "how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley\n",
       "must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from\n",
       "Donwell?-- Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell.  I cannot at all\n",
       "consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all\n",
       "likely.  I am amazed that you should think of such a thing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.  I do not\n",
       "want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the\n",
       "idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really\n",
       "wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's account, a\n",
       "boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I would.  I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.-- Mr.\n",
       "Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt\n",
       "it now.  And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\n",
       "know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the imprudence of such a match!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\n",
       "what you mention.  His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\n",
       "be quite enough to account for the horses.  He has a great regard for\n",
       "the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad\n",
       "to shew them attention.  My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to\n",
       "match-making.  You do it very ill.  Jane Fairfax mistress of the\n",
       "Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts.  For his own sake, I would\n",
       "not have him do so mad a thing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.  Excepting inequality of\n",
       "fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing\n",
       "unsuitable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.  I am sure he has not the\n",
       "least idea of it.  Do not put it into his head.  Why should he marry?--\n",
       "He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,\n",
       "and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond\n",
       "of his brother's children.  He has no occasion to marry, either to fill\n",
       "up his time or his heart.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really\n",
       "loves Jane Fairfax--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nonsense!  He does not care about Jane Fairfax.  In the way of love, I\n",
       "am sure he does not.  He would do any good to her, or her family; but--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \"perhaps the greatest good he could\n",
       "do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\n",
       "very shameful and degrading connexion.  How would he bear to have Miss\n",
       "Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\n",
       "him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?-- 'So very\n",

       "of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united\n",
       "voices gave only momentary interruptions.  Her objections to Mr.\n",
       "Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside.  She could see\n",
       "nothing but evil in it.  It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John\n",
       "Knightley; consequently to Isabella.  A real injury to the children--a\n",
       "most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great\n",
       "deduction from her father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she\n",

       "They talked at first only of the performance.  His admiration was\n",
       "certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not\n",
       "have struck her.  As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak\n",
       "of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer\n",
       "was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I often feel concern,\" said she, \"that I dare not make our carriage\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,\" he replied;--\n",

       "Another song, however, was soon begged for.  \"One more;--they would not\n",

       "that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space.  Mrs.\n",
       "Weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an\n",
       "irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming\n",
       "gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\n",
       "\n",
       "While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\n",
       "Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\n",
       "voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\n",
       "Knightley.  This would be a trial.  He was no dancer in general.  If he\n",
       "were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\n",
       "something.  There was no immediate appearance.  No; he was talking to\n",
       "Mrs. Cole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody\n",
       "else, and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\n",
       "she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.  Not more than\n",
       "five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it\n",
       "made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\n",
       "partner.  They were a couple worth looking at.\n",
       "\n",
       "Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.  It was\n",

       "mother's account.  After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to\n",

       "be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity.  She must have\n",

       "left a name behind her that would not soon die away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\n",
       "points on which she was not quite easy.  She doubted whether she had\n",
       "not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her\n",
       "suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill.  It was\n",
       "hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would escape\n",
       "her, and his submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her\n",
       "penetration, which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that\n",
       "she ought to have held her tongue.\n",
       "\n",
       "The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\n",
       "there she had no doubt.  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret\n",
       "the inferiority of her own playing and singing.  She did most heartily\n",
       "grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised\n",
       "vigorously an hour and a half.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.  The\n",
       "truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\n",
       "but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\n",
       "that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.  Mr.\n",
       "Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a\n",

       "\"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will\n",

       "Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\n",
       "office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\n",
       "stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\n",

       "dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the\n",
       "gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused\n",
       "enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.  A mind lively and at\n",

       "She looked down the Randalls road.  The scene enlarged; two persons\n",
       "appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\n",

       "eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and\n",
       "the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\n",

       "indifferent tone--what shall I say?  I shall be no support to Mrs.\n",
       "Weston.  She might do very well by herself.  A disagreeable truth would\n",

       "world at a civil falsehood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not believe any such thing,\" replied Emma.--\"I am persuaded that\n",
       "you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\n",

       "the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\n",
       "muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\n",

       "\n",

       "No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.  But then, Mrs.\n",
       "Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown home\n",
       "any day.  But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go to\n",
       "Hartfield--at least the ribbon.  You could make it into two parcels,\n",

       "and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.\n",
       "How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs.\n",

       "job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the\n",
       "most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my\n",
       "mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.-- So\n",
       "very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles--could not\n",
       "put them on.  And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of\n",
       "spectacles; they should indeed.  Jane said so.  I meant to take them\n",
       "over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other\n",
       "hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no\n",
       "saying what, you know.  At one time Patty came to say she thought the\n",

       "your bad news to me.  Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles\n",
       "out.  Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her\n",
       "boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises,\n",
       "always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil\n",
       "and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but the\n",
       "greatest attention from them.  And it cannot be for the value of our\n",
       "custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?  Only three\n",
       "of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats\n",
       "nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened\n",
       "if you saw it.  I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I\n",
       "say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off.  But about the\n",
       "middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so\n",
       "well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I\n",
       "took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to\n",
       "meet him in the street.  Not that I had any doubt before-- I have so\n",
       "often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.  I believe it is the\n",
       "only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome.  We\n",
       "have apple-dumplings, however, very often.  Patty makes an excellent\n",
       "apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and\n",
       "these ladies will oblige us.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"How do you do, Mrs. Ford?  I beg your pardon.  I did not see you\n",
       "before.  I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from\n",

       "very well--only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking\n",
       "them in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What was I talking of?\" said she, beginning again when they were all\n",
       "in the street.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's\n",

       "'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\n",
       "excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so very. . . . Indeed I\n",
       "must say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had\n",
       "expected, he very far exceeds any thing. . . . I do congratulate you,\n",
       "Mrs. Weston, most warmly.  He seems every thing the fondest parent\n",
       "could. . . . 'Oh!' said he, 'I can fasten the rivet.  I like a job of\n",
       "that sort excessively.' I never shall forget his manner.  And when I\n",
       "brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends\n",
       "would be so very obliging as to take some, 'Oh!' said he directly,\n",
       "'there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the\n",
       "finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.'  That, you\n",
       "know, was so very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no\n",
       "compliment.  Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis\n",
       "does them full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,\n",
       "and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--but\n",
       "Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.  The apples\n",
       "themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all\n",
       "from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply.  He sends us\n",
       "a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple\n",
       "anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there is two of them.  My\n",
       "mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days.  But I\n",
       "was really quite shocked the other day--for Mr. Knightley called one\n",
       "morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and\n",
       "said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to\n",
       "the end of our stock.  'I am sure you must be,' said he, 'and I will\n",
       "send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever\n",
       "use.  William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this\n",
       "year.  I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.' So\n",
       "I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could not\n",
       "absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half a dozen\n",
       "indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all\n",
       "bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been\n",
       "already; and Jane said the same.  And when he was gone, she almost\n",
       "quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a\n",
       "quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the\n",
       "apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a\n",
       "great many left.  Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could.\n",
       "However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large\n",
       "basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was\n",
       "very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said\n",
       "every thing, as you may suppose.  William Larkins is such an old\n",
       "acquaintance!  I am always glad to see him.  But, however, I found\n",
       "afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of\n",
       "_that_ sort his master had; he had brought them all--and now his master\n",
       "had not one left to bake or boil.  William did not seem to mind it\n",
       "himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for\n",
       "William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing;\n",
       "but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent\n",
       "away.  She could not bear that her master should not be able to have\n",
       "another apple-tart this spring.  He told Patty this, but bid her not\n",
       "mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs.\n",
       "Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were\n",
       "sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.  And so Patty told me,\n",
       "and I was excessively shocked indeed!  I would not have Mr. Knightley\n",
       "know any thing about it for the world!  He would be so very. . . . I\n",
       "wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had\n",
       "mentioned it before I was aware.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\n",

       "\n",
       "He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\n",

       "ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.  That she was not\n",
       "immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her\n",

       "again.\n",

       "At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\n",

       "\"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\n",

       "hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold\n",
       "their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a\n",

       "of Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no\n",
       "music here.  I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews\n",

       "\n",
       "And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\n",

       "\n",
       "It may be possible to do without dancing entirely.  Instances have been\n",
       "known of young people passing many, many months successively, without\n",
       "being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\n",
       "either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the\n",
       "felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--it\n",
       "must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\n",
       "and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\n",
       "to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\n",
       "people in schemes on the subject.  Frank's was the first idea; and his\n",
       "the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of\n",
       "the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and\n",
       "appearance.  But still she had inclination enough for shewing people\n",
       "again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse\n",
       "danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself\n",
       "with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of\n",
       "the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room\n",
       "they were in to see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking\n",
       "the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in\n",
       "spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size,\n",
       "that it was a little the largest.\n",
       "\n",
       "His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's\n",
       "should be finished there--that the same party should be collected, and\n",
       "the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.  Mr.\n",
       "Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\n",
       "most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\n",
       "and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly\n",
       "who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of\n",
       "space to every couple.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\n",
       "Coxes five,\" had been repeated many times over.  \"And there will be the\n",
       "two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\n",
       "Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.  You and Miss Smith, and\n",
       "Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\n",
       "couple there will be plenty of room.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "On another,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\n",
       "stand up.  Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\n",
       "It will not do to _invite_ five couple.  It can be allowable only as\n",
       "the thought of the moment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother's, and\n",
       "must be invited with the rest.  Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\n",
       "would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked.  A word was\n",
       "put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one\n",
       "family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old\n",
       "acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the\n",
       "five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation\n",
       "in what possible manner they could be disposed of.\n",
       "\n",
       "The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.  \"Might not\n",
       "they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\" It seemed the best\n",
       "scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\n",
       "better.  Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress\n",
       "about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score\n",
       "of health.  It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\n",
       "persevered in.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no,\" said he; \"it would be the extreme of imprudence.  I could not\n",
       "bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.  She would catch a dreadful\n",
       "cold.  So would poor little Harriet.  So you would all.  Mrs. Weston,\n",
       "you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing.\n",
       "Pray do not let them talk of it.  That young man (speaking lower) is\n",
       "very thoughtless.  Do not tell his father, but that young man is not\n",
       "quite the thing.  He has been opening the doors very often this\n",
       "evening, and keeping them open very inconsiderately.  He does not think\n",
       "of the draught.  I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is\n",
       "not quite the thing!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.  She knew the importance of\n",
       "it, and said every thing in her power to do it away.  Every door was\n",
       "now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing\n",
       "only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such\n",
       "good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of\n",
       "an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was\n",
       "now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We were too magnificent,\" said he.  \"We allowed unnecessary room.  Ten\n",
       "couple may stand here very well.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma demurred.  \"It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be\n",
       "worse than dancing without space to turn in?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very true,\" he gravely replied; \"it was very bad.\"  But still he went\n",
       "on measuring, and still he ended with,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no,\" said she, \"you are quite unreasonable.  It would be dreadful\n",
       "to be standing so close!  Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to\n",
       "be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is no denying it,\" he replied.  \"I agree with you exactly.  A\n",
       "crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving\n",
       "pictures in a few words.  Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,\n",
       "having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up.  It\n",
       "would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know\n",
       "that--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very\n",
       "well.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\n",
       "self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\n",
       "dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\n",
       "Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\n",
       "pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\n",
       "and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\n",
       "acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\n",
       "the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\n",
       "the scheme.  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" he almost immediately began, \"your inclination\n",
       "for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\n",
       "of my father's little rooms.  I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a\n",
       "thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted\n",
       "upon.  May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\n",
       "of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\n",
       "Crown Inn?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The Crown!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you\n",
       "cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him\n",
       "there.  Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less\n",
       "grateful welcome than at Randalls.  It is his own idea.  Mrs. Weston\n",
       "sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied.  This is what we\n",
       "all feel.  Oh! you were perfectly right!  Ten couple, in either of the\n",
       "Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how\n",
       "right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_\n",
       "_thing_ to like to yield.  Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I\n",
       "hope you consent?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\n",
       "Weston do not.  I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\n",
       "myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could\n",
       "be.  Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\n",
       "comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\n",
       "necessary to make it acceptable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much\n",
       "worse than the other.  A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\n",
       "never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited.  If they must dance, they\n",
       "had better dance at Randalls.  He had never been in the room at the\n",
       "Crown in his life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh!\n",
       "no--a very bad plan.  They would catch worse colds at the Crown than\n",
       "anywhere.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was going to observe, sir,\" said Frank Churchill, \"that one of the\n",
       "great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of\n",
       "any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at\n",
       "Randalls!  Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\n",
       "nobody else could.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sir,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \"you are very much mistaken\n",
       "if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.  Mr. Perry is\n",
       "extremely concerned when any of us are ill.  But I do not understand\n",
       "how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's\n",
       "house.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.  We shall have no\n",
       "occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it\n",
       "is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\n",
       "heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\n",
       "opening the windows at Randalls.  Nobody could be so imprudent!  I\n",
       "never heard of such a thing.  Dancing with open windows!--I am sure,\n",
       "neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would\n",
       "suffer it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\n",
       "window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.  I\n",
       "have often known it done myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!  I never could have supposed it.  But\n",
       "I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.\n",
       "However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to\n",
       "talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal of\n",
       "consideration.  One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.  If Mr. and\n",
       "Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may\n",
       "talk it over, and see what can be done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" interrupted Emma, \"there will be plenty of time for talking every\n",
       "thing over.  There is no hurry at all.  If it can be contrived to be at\n",
       "the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.  They will\n",
       "be so near their own stable.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So they will, my dear.  That is a great thing.  Not that James ever\n",
       "complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.  If I could\n",
       "be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be\n",
       "trusted?  I doubt it.  I do not know her, even by sight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\n",
       "under Mrs. Weston's care.  Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\n",
       "is carefulness itself.  Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so\n",
       "many years ago, when I had the measles?  'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes\n",
       "to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'  How often\n",
       "have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Aye, very true.  Mr. Perry did say so.  I shall never forget it.  Poor\n",
       "little Emma!  You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would\n",
       "have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention.  He came four\n",
       "times a day for a week.  He said, from the first, it was a very good\n",
       "sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful\n",
       "complaint.  I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the\n",
       "measles, she will send for Perry.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\" said Frank\n",
       "Churchill, \"examining the capabilities of the house.  I left them there\n",
       "and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\n",
       "might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot.  I\n",
       "was desired to say so from both.  It would be the greatest pleasure to\n",
       "them, if you could allow me to attend you there.  They can do nothing\n",
       "satisfactorily without you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\n",
       "engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\n",
       "set off together without delay for the Crown.  There were Mr. and Mrs.\n",
       "Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\n",
       "very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and\n",
       "he, finding every thing perfect.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Emma,\" said she, \"this paper is worse than I expected.  Look! in\n",
       "places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow\n",
       "and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear, you are too particular,\" said her husband.  \"What does all\n",
       "that signify?  You will see nothing of it by candlelight.  It will be\n",
       "as clean as Randalls by candlelight.  We never see any thing of it on\n",
       "our club-nights.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \"Men never know\n",
       "when things are dirty or not;\" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each\n",
       "to himself, \"Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\n",
       "It regarded a supper-room.  At the time of the ballroom's being built,\n",
       "suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\n",
       "the only addition.  What was to be done?  This card-room would be\n",
       "wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted\n",
       "unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for any\n",
       "comfortable supper?  Another room of much better size might be secured\n",
       "for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long\n",
       "awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.  This made a\n",
       "difficulty.  Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in\n",
       "that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the\n",
       "prospect of being miserably crowded at supper.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c.,\n",
       "set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\n",
       "suggestion.  A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\n",
       "pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs.\n",
       "Weston must not speak of it again.  She then took another line of\n",
       "expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not think it _is_ so very small.  We shall not be many, you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps\n",
       "through the passage, was calling out,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.  It is a\n",
       "mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish,\" said Mrs. Weston, \"one could know which arrangement our\n",
       "guests in general would like best.  To do what would be most generally\n",
       "pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, very true,\" cried Frank, \"very true.  You want your neighbours'\n",
       "opinions.  I do not wonder at you.  If one could ascertain what the\n",
       "chief of them--the Coles, for instance.  They are not far off.  Shall I\n",

       "constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but\n",
       "at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration,\n",
       "a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all\n",

       "When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\n",
       "she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at\n",
       "first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\n",
       "undervalued their strength.  It was a long, well-written letter, giving\n",
       "the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\n",
       "affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and\n",
       "describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\n",
       "attractive, with spirit and precision.  No suspicious flourishes now of\n",
       "apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\n",
       "Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\n",
       "between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\n",
       "just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much\n",
       "more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The\n",
       "charm of her own name was not wanting.  _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared\n",
       "more than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion,\n",
       "either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had\n",
       "said; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it\n",
       "was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the\n",
       "effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps\n",
       "of all conveyed.  Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were\n",
       "these words--\"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for\n",
       "Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.  Pray make my excuses and\n",
       "adieus to her.\"  This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself.\n",
       "Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend.  His information\n",
       "and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had\n",
       "been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet,\n",
       "even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\n",
       "part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\n",
       "to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she\n",
       "could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without\n",
       "her.  Her intentions were unchanged.  Her resolution of refusal only\n",
       "grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent\n",
       "consolation and happiness.  His recollection of Harriet, and the words\n",
       "which clothed it, the \"beautiful little friend,\" suggested to her the\n",
       "idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections.  Was it\n",
       "impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\n",
       "understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of\n",
       "her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\n",
       "probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For\n",
       "Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must not dwell upon it,\" said she.--\"I must not think of it.  I know\n",
       "the danger of indulging such speculations.  But stranger things have\n",
       "happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\n",

       "Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest\n",
       "interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank\n",
       "Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most\n",
       "irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named.  He would soon be among\n",
       "them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.  There was hardly time to talk\n",
       "over the first letter from Enscombe before \"Mr. Elton and his bride\"\n",
       "was in every body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten.  Emma\n",
       "grew sick at the sound.  She had had three weeks of happy exemption\n",
       "from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had\n",
       "been lately gaining strength.  With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least,\n",
       "there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it\n",
       "was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure\n",
       "as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage, bell-ringing,\n",
       "and all.\n",
       "\n",
       "Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\n",
       "reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\n",
       "give.  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet\n",
       "had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy\n",
       "work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever\n",
       "agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same.  Harriet\n",
       "listened submissively, and said \"it was very true--it was just as Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to think about them--and\n",
       "she would not think about them any longer\" but no change of subject\n",
       "could avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless\n",

       "you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will\n",

       "\"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\n",
       "less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\n",
       "would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than\n",
       "my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is\n",
       "your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the\n",
       "suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your\n",
       "tranquillity.  These are the motives which I have been pressing on you.\n",
       "They are very important--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them\n",
       "sufficiently to act upon them.  My being saved from pain is a very\n",
       "secondary consideration.  I want you to save yourself from greater\n",

       "what was due--or rather what would be kind by me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.  The idea of\n",
       "wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\n",
       "loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\n",
       "of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt\n",

       "tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all\n",
       "the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.\n",
       "It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Elton was first seen at church:  but though devotion might be\n",
       "interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\n",
       "it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\n",
       "settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\n",
       "not pretty at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to\n",
       "make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she\n",
       "made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the\n",
       "business might be gone through as soon as possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\n",
       "which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\n",
       "lace up her boot, without _recollecting_.  A thousand vexatious\n",
       "thoughts would recur.  Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;\n",
       "and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be\n",
       "recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale\n",
       "and silent.  The visit was of course short; and there was so much\n",
       "embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not\n",
       "allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no\n",
       "account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being\n",
       "\"elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not really like her.  She would not be in a hurry to find\n",
       "fault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not\n",
       "elegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a\n",
       "bride, there was too much ease.  Her person was rather good; her face\n",
       "not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were\n",
       "elegant.  Emma thought at least it would turn out so.\n",
       "\n",
       "As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would not\n",
       "permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.  It was\n",
       "an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a\n",
       "man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.  The woman\n",
       "was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\n",
       "privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\n",
       "depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\n",
       "Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\n",
       "married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\n",
       "been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\n",
       "little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\n",
       "could be.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse,\" said Harriet, when they had quitted the house,\n",
       "and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; \"Well, Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?-- Is not she\n",
       "very charming?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;\n",
       "and she came in his way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I dare say,\" returned Harriet, sighing again, \"I dare say she was very\n",
       "much attached to him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman\n",
       "who loves him best.  Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought\n",
       "this the best offer she was likely to have.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" said Harriet earnestly, \"and well she might, nobody could ever\n",
       "have a better.  Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.  And now,\n",
       "Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.  He is\n",
       "just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a\n",
       "different thing.  No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I\n",
       "can sit and admire him now without any great misery.  To know that he\n",
       "has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!-- She does seem a\n",
       "charming young woman, just what he deserves.  Happy creature!  He\n",
       "called her 'Augusta.'  How delightful!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.  She could then see\n",
       "more and judge better.  From Harriet's happening not to be at\n",
       "Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had\n",
       "a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could\n",
       "composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced\n",
       "her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with\n",
       "herself, and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to\n",
       "shine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a\n",
       "bad school, pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one\n",
       "set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she was\n",
       "ignorant, and that her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet would have been a better match.  If not wise or refined\n",
       "herself, she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss\n",
       "Hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been\n",
       "the best of her own set.  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the\n",
       "pride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride\n",
       "of him.\n",
       "\n",
       "The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \"My brother\n",
       "Mr. Suckling's seat;\"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.  The\n",
       "grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\n",
       "modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by\n",
       "the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\n",
       "imagine.  \"Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the\n",
       "likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at\n",
       "Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.\"-- Mr. Elton was appealed\n",
       "to.--\"Was not it astonishingly like?-- She could really almost fancy\n",
       "herself at Maple Grove.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like\n",
       "the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.  I\n",
       "really could not help exclaiming!  I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is\n",
       "very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely\n",
       "partial to as Maple Grove.  I have spent so many happy months there!\n",
       "(with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly.\n",
       "Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been\n",
       "quite a home.  Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse,\n",
       "you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at\n",
       "all like what one has left behind.  I always say this is quite one of\n",
       "the evils of matrimony.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\n",
       "for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So extremely like Maple Grove!  And it is not merely the house--the\n",
       "grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\n",
       "The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\n",
       "very much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of\n",
       "a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\n",
       "mind!  My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place.  People\n",
       "who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\n",
       "in the same style.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.  She had a great idea that\n",
       "people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\n",
       "extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to\n",
       "attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think\n",
       "you have overrated Hartfield.  Surry is full of beauties.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.  It is the garden of England, you\n",
       "know.  Surry is the garden of England.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.  Many\n",
       "counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\n",
       "Surry.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I fancy not,\" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\" I\n",
       "never heard any county but Surry called so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was silenced.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or\n",
       "summer at farthest,\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"and that will be our time\n",
       "for exploring.  While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal,\n",
       "I dare say.  They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which\n",
       "holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_\n",
       "carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely\n",
       "well.  They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season\n",
       "of the year.  Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly\n",
       "recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much\n",
       "preferable.  When people come into a beautiful country of this sort,\n",
       "you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as\n",
       "possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring.  We explored\n",
       "to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully,\n",
       "just after their first having the barouche-landau.  You have many\n",
       "parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; not immediately here.  We are rather out of distance of the very\n",
       "striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and\n",
       "we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at\n",
       "home than engage in schemes of pleasure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.  Nobody\n",
       "can be more devoted to home than I am.  I was quite a proverb for it at\n",
       "Maple Grove.  Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to\n",
       "Bristol, 'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house.  I\n",
       "absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the\n",
       "barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her\n",
       "own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.'  Many a time\n",
       "has she said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion.  I\n",
       "think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from\n",
       "society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to\n",
       "mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too\n",
       "much or too little.  I perfectly understand your situation, however,\n",
       "Miss Woodhouse--(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state\n",
       "of health must be a great drawback.  Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed\n",

       "Bath life, I have seen such instances of it!  And it is so cheerful a\n",
       "place, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's\n",
       "spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed.  And as to\n",
       "its recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to\n",
       "dwell on them.  The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty\n",
       "generally understood.  It would be a charming introduction for you, who\n",
       "have lived so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some\n",
       "of the best society in the place.  A line from me would bring you a\n",
       "little host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge,\n",
       "the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy\n",
       "to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to go\n",
       "into public with.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.  The idea of\n",
       "her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\n",
       "_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\n",
       "of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the\n",
       "help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!-- The dignity of Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\n",
       "\n",
       "She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could\n",
       "have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \"but their going to\n",
       "Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced\n",
       "that the place might suit her better than her father.\" And then, to\n",
       "prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.  Upon these\n",
       "occasions, a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has\n",
       "long known that you are a superior performer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.  A superior\n",
       "performer!--very far from it, I assure you.  Consider from how partial\n",
       "a quarter your information came.  I am doatingly fond of\n",
       "music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid\n",
       "of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\n",
       "_mediocre_ to the last degree.  You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\n",
       "delightfully.  I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\n",
       "comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\n",
       "into.  I absolutely cannot do without music.  It is a necessary of life\n",
       "to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\n",
       "Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice.\n",
       "I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future\n",
       "home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\n",
       "disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had\n",
       "been accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\n",
       "When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\n",
       "_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of\n",
       "retirement.  Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world\n",
       "was not necessary to _me_.  I could do very well without it.  To those\n",
       "who had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me\n",
       "quite independent.  And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used\n",
       "to, I really could not give it a thought.  I hoped I was perfectly\n",
       "equal to any sacrifice of that description.  Certainly I had been\n",
       "accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that\n",
       "two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious\n",
       "apartments.  'But,' said I, 'to be quite honest, I do not think I can\n",
       "live without something of a musical society.  I condition for nothing\n",
       "else; but without music, life would be a blank to me.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We cannot suppose,\" said Emma, smiling, \"that Mr. Elton would hesitate\n",
       "to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\n",
       "I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\n",
       "pardoned, in consideration of the motive.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.  I am delighted to\n",
       "find myself in such a circle.  I hope we shall have many sweet little\n",
       "concerts together.  I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\n",
       "musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\n",
       "Will not it be a good plan?  If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\n",
       "not be long in want of allies.  Something of that nature would be\n",
       "particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\n",
       "practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against\n",
       "them, in general.  They are but too apt to give up music.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,\n",
       "surely?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my\n",
       "acquaintance, I tremble.  Selina has entirely given up music--never\n",
       "touches the instrument--though she played sweetly.  And the same may be\n",
       "said of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two\n",
       "Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can\n",
       "enumerate.  Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.  I used\n",
       "to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend\n",
       "that a married woman has many things to call her attention.  I believe\n",
       "I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But every thing of that kind,\" said Emma, \"will soon be in so regular\n",
       "a train--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \"we shall see.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\n",
       "more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\n",
       "subject.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have been calling at Randalls,\" said she, \"and found them both at\n",
       "home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.  I like them extremely.\n",
       "Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite\n",
       "with me already, I assure you.  And _she_ appears so truly good--there\n",
       "is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon\n",
       "one directly.  She was your governess, I think?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\n",
       "waited for the affirmative before she went on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\n",
       "lady-like!  But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mrs. Weston's manners,\" said Emma, \"were always particularly good.\n",
       "Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\n",
       "model for any young woman.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And who do you think came in while we were there?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was quite at a loss.  The tone implied some old acquaintance--and\n",
       "how could she possibly guess?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Knightley!\" continued Mrs. Elton; \"Knightley himself!--Was not it\n",
       "lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\n",
       "seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s,\n",
       "I had a great curiosity.  'My friend Knightley' had been so often\n",
       "mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\n",
       "caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his\n",
       "friend.  Knightley is quite the gentleman.  I like him very much.\n",
       "Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Happily, it was now time to be gone.  They were off; and Emma could\n",
       "breathe.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Insufferable woman!\" was her immediate exclamation.  \"Worse than I had\n",
       "supposed.  Absolutely insufferable!  Knightley!--I could not have\n",
       "believed it.  Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and call\n",
       "him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman!  A little upstart,\n",
       "vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\n",
       "resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\n",
       "Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman!  I doubt\n",
       "whether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady.\n",
       "I could not have believed it!  And to propose that she and I should\n",
       "unite to form a musical club!  One would fancy we were bosom friends!\n",
       "And Mrs. Weston!-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up\n",
       "should be a gentlewoman!  Worse and worse.  I never met with her equal.\n",
       "Much beyond my hopes.  Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.  Oh!\n",
       "what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?  How angry and\n",
       "how diverted he would be!  Ah! there I am--thinking of him directly.\n",
       "Always the first person to be thought of!  How I catch myself out!\n",
       "Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her\n",
       "father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure,\n",
       "and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, my dear,\" he deliberately began, \"considering we never saw her\n",
       "before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\n",
       "was very much pleased with you.  She speaks a little too quick.  A\n",
       "little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.  But I\n",
       "believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like\n",
       "you and poor Miss Taylor.  However, she seems a very obliging,\n",
       "pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.\n",
       "Though I think he had better not have married.  I made the best excuses\n",
       "I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this\n",
       "happy occasion; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the\n",
       "summer.  But I ought to have gone before.  Not to wait upon a bride is\n",
       "very remiss.  Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am!  But I do not like\n",
       "the corner into Vicarage Lane.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.  Mr. Elton knows you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes:  but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to\n",
       "her if possible.  It was being very deficient.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\n",
       "should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_?  It ought\n",
       "to be no recommendation to _you_.  It is encouraging people to marry if\n",
       "you make so much of them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\n",
       "wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,\n",
       "is never to be neglected.  More is avowedly due to _her_.  A bride, you\n",
       "know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\n",
       "they may.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\n",

       "to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear, you do not understand me.  This is a matter of mere common\n",

       "encouragement to people to marry.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma had done.  Her father was growing nervous, and could not\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\n",
       "opinion of Mrs. Elton.  Her observation had been pretty correct.  Such\n",
       "as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she\n",
       "appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar,\n",
       "ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little\n",
       "accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself coming\n",
       "with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country\n",
       "neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in\n",
       "society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently\n",
       "from his wife.  He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.  He had\n",
       "the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to\n",
       "Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part\n",
       "of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of\n",
       "judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for\n",
       "granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she\n",
       "professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's\n",
       "praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by\n",
       "Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked\n",
       "with a good grace of her being \"very pleasant and very elegantly\n",
       "dressed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\n",
       "first.  Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the\n",
       "little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\n",
       "back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\n",
       "though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\n",
       "necessarily increasing Emma's dislike.  Her manners, too--and Mr.\n",
       "Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet.  They were sneering and\n",
       "negligent.  Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the\n",
       "sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\n",
       "much.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been\n",
       "an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story,\n",
       "under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to\n",
       "him, had in all likelihood been given also.  She was, of course, the\n",
       "object of their joint dislike.-- When they had nothing else to say, it\n",
       "must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity\n",
       "which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader\n",
       "vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.  Not\n",
       "merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\n",
       "recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\n",
       "with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without\n",
       "solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\n",
       "befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\n",
       "third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry\n",
       "on the subject.--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave\n",

       "extraordinary talents.  I do not scruple to say that she plays\n",
       "extremely well.  I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that\n",

       "follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations.  _We_\n",
       "have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\n",
       "which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\n",
       "least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\n",
       "send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\n",
       "than Jane Fairfax to partake of it.  I have no idea of that sort of\n",
       "thing.  It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\n",
       "used to.  My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite\n",
       "the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.\n",

       "shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.  My\n",
       "acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing\n",

       "very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us.  I am\n",
       "sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets a little\n",
       "acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off, for there\n",

       "conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they are with\n",

       "great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.-- She is _not_\n",
       "to be with the _Dixons_.  The decree is issued by somebody.  But why\n",

       "early implanted.  We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that\n",
       "we may have been very full of the hour before.  We feel things\n",
       "differently.  And besides the operation of this, as a general\n",
       "principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her\n",
       "superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton\n",
       "treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to.  Such a woman\n",
       "as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no\n",

       "littleness in action, if not in consciousness.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No indeed I have not.  You have scolded me too much for match-making,\n",

       "enough in familiar vulgarity?  She calls you, Knightley--what can she\n",
       "do for Mr. Cole?  And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax\n",
       "accepts her civilities and consents to be with her.  Mrs. Weston, your\n",

       "temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the\n",
       "triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton.  I have no faith in\n",

       "Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\n",
       "disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.  Dinner-parties and\n",
       "evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\n",
       "in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\n",
       "never to have a disengaged day.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see how it is,\" said she.  \"I see what a life I am to lead among\n",
       "you.  Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.  We really seem\n",
       "quite the fashion.  If this is living in the country, it is nothing\n",
       "very formidable.  From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have\n",
       "not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need\n",
       "not have been at a loss.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "No invitation came amiss to her.  Her Bath habits made evening-parties\n",
       "perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\n",
       "dinners.  She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\n",
       "the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\n",
       "card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\n",
       "good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon\n",
       "shew them how every thing ought to be arranged.  In the course of the\n",
       "spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party--in\n",
       "which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\n",
       "unbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the\n",

       "refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\n",
       "Hartfield for the Eltons.  They must not do less than others, or she\n",
       "should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\n",
       "resentment.  A dinner there must be.  After Emma had talked about it\n",
       "for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\n",
       "usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\n",
       "with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\n",
       "\n",
       "The persons to be invited, required little thought.  Besides the\n",
       "Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\n",
       "course--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet\n",
       "must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given\n",
       "with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly\n",
       "pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it.  \"She would\n",
       "rather not be in his company more than she could help.  She was not yet\n",
       "quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together, without\n",

       "would rather stay at home.\" It was precisely what Emma would have\n",
       "wished, had she deemed it possible enough for wishing.  She was\n",
       "delighted with the fortitude of her little friend--for fortitude she\n",

       "she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the\n",
       "eighth, Jane Fairfax.-- Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston\n",
       "and Mr. Knightley, she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax\n",
       "than she had often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her.  He had\n",
       "said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody\n",

       "\n",

       "Every invitation was successful.  They were all disengaged and all\n",
       "happy.-- The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\n",

       "Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\n",
       "weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\n",
       "staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day\n",
       "of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being\n",
       "put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\n",
       "so.  Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\n",
       "utmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma\n",
       "apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\n",

       "falling in with a dinner-party.\n",
       "\n",
       "She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\n",
       "representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he\n",
       "always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\n",
       "immaterial.  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\n",
       "have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\n",
       "instead of his brother.\n",
       "\n",
       "The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.  John\n",

       "The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\n",
       "Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\n",
       "agreeable.  Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\n",
       "waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.  Mrs. Elton, as\n",
       "elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--\n",
       "wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss\n",
       "Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk to\n",
       "her.  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk\n",
       "with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain.  It was\n",
       "natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\n",
       "\n",

       "body.  I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much\n",
       "less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself\n",
       "which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.  You have\n",
       "every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall\n",
       "again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a\n",

       "Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be\n",
       "particularly careful, especially at this time of year.  The spring I\n",
       "always think requires more than common care.  Better wait an hour or\n",
       "two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing\n",
       "on your cough again.  Now do not you feel that you had?  Yes, I am sure\n",

       "\n",
       "\"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!\" said she.-- \"The\n",
       "regularity and despatch of it!  If one thinks of all that it has to do,\n",

       "actually lost!  And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\n",

       "\n",
       "\"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some\n",

       "That is the key to a great deal of capacity.  The public pays and must\n",
       "be served well.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have heard it asserted,\" said John Knightley, \"that the same sort of\n",
       "handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\n",
       "teaches, it is natural enough.  But for that reason, I should imagine\n",
       "the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have\n",
       "very little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand\n",
       "they can get.  Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike.  I\n",
       "have not always known their writing apart.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\n",
       "before all these people?  Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\n",

       "would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce\n",
       "his name without the smallest distress.  I certainly get better and\n",
       "better.--Now for it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\"Mr. Frank Churchill\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I do not admire it,\" said Mr. Knightley.  \"It is too small--wants\n",

       "\n",
       "This was not submitted to by either lady.  They vindicated him against\n",
       "the base aspersion.  \"No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a\n",
       "large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.  Had not Mrs. Weston\n",
       "any letter about her to produce?\"  No, she had heard from him very\n",
       "lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If we were in the other room,\" said Emma, \"if I had my writing-desk, I\n",
       "am sure I could produce a specimen.  I have a note of his.-- Do not you\n",
       "remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He chose to say he was employed\"--\n",

       "_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in\n",
       "full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had\n",

       "over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.  I must put on a few ornaments\n",
       "now, because it is expected of me.  A bride, you know, must appear like\n",
       "a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of\n",
       "dress is so infinitely preferable to finery.  But I am quite in the\n",
       "minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of\n",

       "mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent his evening quietly\n",
       "at home after a day of business in London, should set off again, and\n",

       "company till bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility\n",
       "and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply.  A\n",
       "man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and\n",
       "might now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have\n",
       "been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been\n",
       "alone!--Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his\n",
       "own fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out\n",
       "again into the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly\n",
       "taken back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming\n",
       "would probably prolong rather than break up the party.  John Knightley\n",

       "forth--I always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so\n",
       "it has, you see.  I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my\n",

       "mend the next.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the\n",
       "rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and\n",
       "exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's\n",
       "saffron robe would be put on for us.  Oh! the pains I have been at to\n",
       "dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!  The\n",

       "seized the opportunity of going on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You were mentioning May.  May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\n",
       "is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\n",
       "Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\n",
       "prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the\n",
       "season of the year which one should have chosen for it:  days almost at\n",
       "the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\n",
       "never too hot for exercise.  When he was here before, we made the best\n",
       "of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there\n",
       "always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\n",
       "intended.  Now will be the time.  This will be complete enjoyment; and\n",
       "I do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\n",
       "sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\n",
       "to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\n",
       "having him actually in the house.  I think it is so.  I think it is the\n",
       "state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.  I hope you will be\n",
       "pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.  He is\n",
       "generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.  Mrs.\n",
       "Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,\n",
       "most gratifying to me.  She thinks nobody equal to him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\n",

       "of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means\n",

       "Churchill.  If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\n",
       "there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me\n",
       "to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.  You cannot be\n",
       "ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the\n",
       "treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of\n",
       "it is to be laid to her.  She was the instigator.  Frank's mother would\n",
       "never have been slighted as she was but for her.  Mr. Churchill has\n",
       "pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's: his is a quiet,\n",
       "indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only\n",
       "make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance\n",
       "and insolence!  And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair\n",
       "pretence of family or blood.  She was nobody when he married her,\n",
       "barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned\n",
       "into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty\n",
       "claims:  but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!  I have quite a\n",
       "horror of upstarts.  Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\n",
       "people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\n",
       "are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\n",
       "themselves!  Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\n",
       "directly.  People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\n",
       "encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense\n",
       "airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established\n",
       "families.  A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have\n",
       "lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.  They\n",
       "came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know,\n",
       "Mr. Weston.  One has not great hopes from Birmingham.  I always say\n",
       "there is something direful in the sound:  but nothing more is\n",
       "positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you\n",
       "are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves\n",
       "equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their\n",
       "nearest neighbours.  It is infinitely too bad.  Mr. Suckling, who has\n",
       "been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it\n",
       "before him--I believe, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling\n",
       "had completed the purchase before his death.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They were interrupted.  Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\n",
       "said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\n",
       "\n",
       "After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\n",
       "Woodhouse to cards.  The remaining five were left to their own powers,\n",
       "and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\n",
       "little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\n",
       "nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of\n",
       "spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.  He was to\n",
       "leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\n",
       "boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at\n",
       "full length there we may be sure.  My charge would be much more concise\n",
       "than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have\n",
       "to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\n",
       "them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I rather hope to satisfy you both,\" said Emma, \"for I shall do all in\n",
       "my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\n",
       "happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is very likely.  You think so, do not you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or even\n",
       "may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue\n",
       "to increase as much as they have done lately.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Increase!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Difference!  No indeed I am not.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\n",
       "than you used to be.  Witness this very time.  Here am I come down for\n",
       "only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!-- When did it\n",
       "happen before, or any thing like it?  Your neighbourhood is increasing,\n",
       "and you mix more with it.  A little while ago, every letter to Isabella\n",
       "brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls\n",
       "at the Crown.  The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in\n",
       "your goings-on, is very great.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" said his brother quickly, \"it is Randalls that does it all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\n",
       "influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,\n",
       "that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.  And if they are, I\n",
       "only beg you to send them home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" cried Mr. Knightley, \"that need not be the consequence.  Let them\n",
       "be sent to Donwell.  I shall certainly be at leisure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" exclaimed Emma, \"you amuse me!  I should like to know\n",
       "how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\n",
       "of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\n",
       "to attend to the little boys.  These amazing engagements of mine--what\n",
       "have they been?  Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked\n",
       "of, which never took place.  I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John\n",
       "Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends\n",
       "at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.  But you,\n",
       "(turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever\n",
       "two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of\n",
       "dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.  And as to my dear little boys, I\n",
       "must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they\n",
       "would fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home\n",
       "about five hours where she is absent one--and who, when he is at home,\n",

       "A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\n",
       "nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.  She\n",
       "was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\n",
       "apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.  Her own attachment had\n",
       "really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--\n",
       "but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of\n",
       "the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which\n",
       "he had taken away, it would be very distressing.  If a separation of\n",
       "two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils\n",
       "before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary.  She\n",
       "did not mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would\n",
       "be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\n",
       "\n",
       "She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\n",
       "That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\n",
       "acquaintance!  and yet, she could not help rather anticipating\n",
       "something decisive.  She felt as if the spring would not pass without\n",
       "bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed\n",
       "and tranquil state.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had\n",
       "foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank\n",
       "Churchill's feelings.  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so\n",
       "soon as had been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.\n",
       "He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he\n",
       "came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise\n",
       "all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was\n",
       "influenced, and how she must act.  They met with the utmost\n",
       "friendliness.  There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing\n",
       "her.  But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\n",
       "had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.  She\n",
       "watched him well.  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had\n",
       "been.  Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference, had\n",
       "produced this very natural and very desirable effect.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\n",
       "delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and\n",
       "he was not without agitation.  It was not in his calmness that she read\n",
       "his comparative difference.  He was not calm; his spirits were\n",
       "evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him.  Lively as he\n",
       "was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what\n",
       "decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an\n",
       "hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.  \"He had seen\n",
       "a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--he had not\n",
       "stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he had the vanity\n",
       "to think they would be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he\n",
       "wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off.\" She had no\n",
       "doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his agitated spirits,\n",
       "nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she was rather\n",
       "inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power, and a\n",
       "discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\n",
       "He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.  His\n",
       "aunt could not bear to have him leave her.  Such was his own account at\n",
       "Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\n",
       "to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no\n",
       "service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder.  That she was\n",
       "really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it,\n",
       "at Randalls.  Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he\n",
       "looked back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been\n",
       "half a year ago.  He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that\n",
       "care and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have\n",
       "many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on,\n",
       "by all his father's doubts, to say that her complaints were merely\n",
       "imaginary, or that she was as strong as ever.\n",
       "\n",
       "It soon appeared that London was not the place for her.  She could not\n",
       "endure its noise.  Her nerves were under continual irritation and\n",
       "suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to Randalls\n",
       "communicated a change of plan.  They were going to remove immediately\n",
       "to Richmond.  Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill\n",
       "of an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place.  A\n",
       "ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\n",
       "expected from the change.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\n",
       "and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\n",
       "before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the\n",
       "house was taken for May and June.  She was told that now he wrote with\n",
       "the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\n",
       "could even wish.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.  He was\n",
       "considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.  She\n",
       "hoped it was not so.  Two months must bring it to the proof.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable.  He was quite delighted.\n",
       "It was the very circumstance he could have wished for.  Now, it would\n",
       "be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.  What were nine miles to\n",
       "a young man?--An hour's ride.  He would be always coming over.  The\n",
       "difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\n",
       "the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never.\n",
       "Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to\n",
       "Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.  Were he ever able to get\n",
       "away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.  There was no\n",
       "comfort in having him in London; he might as well be at Enscombe; but\n",
       "Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.  Better than\n",
       "nearer!\n",
       "\n",
       "One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\n",
       "removal,--the ball at the Crown.  It had not been forgotten before,\n",
       "but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.  Now,\n",
       "however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\n",
       "very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines\n",
       "from Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the\n",
       "change, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for\n",
       "twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Mr. Woodhouse was resigned.  The time of year lightened the evil to\n",
       "him.  May was better for every thing than February.  Mrs. Bates was\n",
       "engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he\n",
       "sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John\n",

       "Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls\n",
       "before dinner, and every thing was safe.\n",
       "\n",
       "No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.  The room at\n",
       "the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a common\n",
       "meeting in a crowd.  Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\n",
       "entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\n",
       "for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort\n",
       "of the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse\n",
       "him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's\n",
       "company.  She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in\n",
       "good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\n",
       "say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\n",
       "They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it\n",
       "should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of\n",
       "another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first,\n",
       "without great surprize.  \"So unreasonably early!\" she was going to\n",
       "exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends,\n",
       "who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr.\n",

       "preparatory inspection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr.\n",
       "Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a\n",
       "man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\n",
       "distinction in the scale of vanity.  She liked his open manners, but a\n",
       "little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\n",
       "character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man\n",
       "what he ought to be.-- She could fancy such a man.  The whole party\n",
       "walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing\n",
       "else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in\n",

       "_May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\n",

       "Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy\n",
       "councillors was not yet larger.  They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door\n",
       "to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\n",
       "brought by the Eltons.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\n",
       "which shewed a mind not at ease.  He was looking about, he was going to\n",
       "the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient\n",
       "to begin, or afraid of being always near her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Elton was spoken of.  \"I think she must be here soon,\" said he.\n",

       "\n",
       "The mistake had been slight.  The carriage was sent for them now.  Emma\n",
       "longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\n",
       "he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\n",
       "graciousness.  He was immediately qualifying himself to form an\n",
       "opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction\n",
       "had passed.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.-- \"I\n",
       "will see that there are umbrellas, sir,\" said Frank to his father:\n",
       "\"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\"  and away he went.  Mr. Weston was\n",
       "following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\n",
       "of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\n",
       "though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.  You know I candidly told\n",
       "you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am\n",
       "extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.  I never compliment.\n",
       "I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely\n",
       "what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least\n",
       "conceit or puppyism.  You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--\n",
       "quite a horror of them.  They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.\n",
       "Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we\n",
       "used sometimes to say very cutting things!  Selina, who is mild almost\n",
       "to a fault, bore with them much better.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but\n",
       "when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\n",
       "just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.  \"I have no doubt of its being our\n",
       "carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.  Our coachman and horses are so\n",
       "extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.-- What\n",
       "a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!-- I understand\n",
       "you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite\n",
       "unnecessary.  You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\n",
       "the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\n",
       "Weston's to receive them.  Her gestures and movements might be\n",
       "understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every\n",
       "body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates,\n",
       "who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes\n",
       "after her being admitted into the circle at the fire.  As the door\n",
       "opened she was heard,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.  Nothing to signify.  I do\n",
       "not care for myself.  Quite thick shoes.  And Jane declares--\n",
       "Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!  This is brilliant\n",
       "indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word.\n",
       "Nothing wanting.  Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--\n",
       "Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?  Oh!  Mr. Weston, you\n",
       "must really have had Aladdin's lamp.  Good Mrs. Stokes would not know\n",
       "her own room again.  I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the\n",
       "entrance.  'Oh!  Mrs. Stokes,' said I--but I had not time for more.\"\n",
       "She was now met by Mrs. Weston.-- \"Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I\n",
       "hope you are quite well.  Very happy to hear it.  So afraid you might\n",
       "have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much\n",
       "trouble you must have.  Delighted to hear it indeed.  Ah! dear Mrs.\n",
       "Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent time.  Jane and I\n",
       "quite ready.  Did not keep the horses a moment.  Most comfortable\n",
       "carriage.-- Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston,\n",
       "on that score.  Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we\n",
       "should have been.-- But two such offers in one day!--Never were such\n",
       "neighbours.  I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am--.'  Thank you,\n",
       "my mother is remarkably well.  Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take\n",

       "Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!  Bought\n",
       "at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice.  There were three others,\n",

       "shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh!  Mr. Frank Churchill, I\n",
       "must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since;\n",
       "the rivet never came out again.  My mother often talks of your\n",
       "good-nature.  Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\n",
       "Churchill?-- Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do\n",
       "you do?-- Very well I thank you, quite well.  This is meeting quite in\n",
       "fairy-land!-- Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know\n",
       "(eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word,\n",

       "Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George\n",
       "and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?  How do you all do?--Quite well, I am\n",
       "much obliged to you.  Never better.-- Don't I hear another\n",
       "carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my\n",
       "word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends!  And\n",
       "such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.  No coffee, I thank you, for\n",

       "every body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the\n",

       "displeasure.-- \"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it,\n",
       "I suppose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How do you like Mrs. Elton?\" said Emma in a whisper.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are ungrateful.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?\"  Then changing from a frown to a\n",
       "smile--\"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--\n",
       "Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.  He\n",
       "walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr.\n",
       "and Mrs. Weston.  He had met with them in a little perplexity, which\n",
       "must be laid before Emma.  It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that\n",
       "Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it;\n",
       "which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that\n",
       "distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\" said Mr. Weston.\n",
       "\"She will think Frank ought to ask her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\n",
       "boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most\n",
       "perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was\n",
       "wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business\n",
       "was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.-- Mr.\n",
       "Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse followed.  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,\n",
       "though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.  It\n",
       "was almost enough to make her think of marrying.  Mrs. Elton had\n",
       "undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely\n",
       "gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill,\n",
       "she could not lose by the change.  Mr. Weston might be his son's\n",
       "superior.-- In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with\n",
       "enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was\n",
       "forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity\n",
       "before her.-- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing\n",
       "than by any thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he\n",
       "ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the\n",
       "husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel\n",
       "an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as\n",
       "he looked!-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps\n",
       "anywhere, than where he had placed himself.  His tall, firm, upright\n",
       "figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly\n",
       "men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting\n",
       "her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who\n",
       "could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer, and those few\n",
       "steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what\n",
       "natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the\n",
       "trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but in\n",
       "general he was looking grave.  She wished he could love a ballroom\n",
       "better, and could like Frank Churchill better.-- He seemed often\n",
       "observing her.  She must not flatter herself that he thought of her\n",
       "dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel\n",
       "afraid.  There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.\n",
       "They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers.  That Frank\n",
       "Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.\n",
       "\n",
       "The ball proceeded pleasantly.  The anxious cares, the incessant\n",
       "attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.  Every body seemed\n",
       "happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\n",
       "bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\n",
       "the very beginning of the existence of this.  Of very important, very\n",
       "recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings\n",
       "usually are.  There was one, however, which Emma thought something\n",
       "of.--The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no\n",
       "partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been\n",
       "hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one\n",
       "disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards,\n",
       "on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.  He would not ask Harriet to\n",
       "dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not--and\n",
       "she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Escape, however, was not his plan.  He came to the part of the room\n",
       "where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in\n",
       "front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of\n",
       "maintaining it.  He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss\n",
       "Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.-- Emma saw it.  She\n",
       "was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and\n",
       "had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a\n",
       "little she saw it all.  When she was half-way up the set, the whole\n",
       "group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes\n",
       "to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a\n",
       "dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and\n",
       "she perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her,\n",
       "was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant\n",
       "glances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to\n",
       "join him and say, \"Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?\" to which his prompt\n",
       "reply was, \"Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself.  I am no\n",
       "dancer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\" said he, \"I shall have great\n",
       "pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\n",
       "married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\n",
       "great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\n",
       "Gilbert.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\n",
       "disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.\"\n",
       "\"Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--\n",
       "and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,\n",
       "Mrs. Weston.  You will excuse me.  Any thing else I should be most\n",
       "happy to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\n",
       "mortification she must be returning to her seat.  This was Mr. Elton!\n",
       "the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.-- She looked round for a\n",
       "moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was\n",
       "arranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee\n",
       "passed between him and his wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "She would not look again.  Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\n",
       "face might be as hot.\n",
       "\n",
       "In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leading\n",
       "Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\n",
       "delighted, than at that instant.  She was all pleasure and gratitude,\n",
       "both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\n",
       "too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\n",
       "catch his eye again.\n",
       "\n",
       "His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\n",
       "and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\n",
       "the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\n",
       "and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\n",
       "announced.  It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than\n",
       "ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of\n",
       "smiles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\n",
       "foolish.  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife,\n",
       "though growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by\n",
       "observing audibly to her partner,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,\n",
       "I declare.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Supper was announced.  The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard\n",
       "from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table\n",
       "and taking up her spoon.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.  Mrs.\n",
       "Weston begs you to put on your tippet.  She says she is afraid there\n",
       "will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One\n",
       "door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.\n",
       "Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging!  How well you put it on!--so\n",
       "gratified!  Excellent dancing indeed!-- Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\n",
       "said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody\n",
       "missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\n",
       "Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\n",
       "vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\n",
       "and baked apples and wine before she came away:  amazing luck in some\n",
       "of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\n",
       "amused, and who were your partners.  'Oh!' said I, 'I shall not\n",
       "forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love\n",
       "to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr.\n",

       "rather?--I am not helpless.  Sir, you are most kind.  Upon my word,\n",
       "Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a\n",
       "little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she\n",
       "looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.  Quite the\n",
       "queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.  Two steps,\n",
       "Jane, take care of the two steps.  Oh! no, there is but one.  Well, I\n",
       "was persuaded there were two.  How very odd!  I was convinced there\n",
       "were two, and there is but one.  I never saw any thing equal to the\n",
       "comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your\n",
       "grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.-- The baked apples\n",
       "and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a\n",
       "delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at\n",
       "first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled\n",
       "enough, sent it all out again.  Now there is nothing grandmama loves\n",
       "better than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed,\n",
       "but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its\n",
       "getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much\n",
       "concerned!--Well, this is brilliant!  I am all amazement! could not\n",
       "have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen\n",
       "nothing like it since-- Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?\n",
       "Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught.  Where _I_ sit is of no\n",
       "consequence.  Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr.\n",
       "Churchill--only it seems too good--but just as you please.  What you\n",
       "direct in this house cannot be wrong.  Dear Jane, how shall we ever\n",
       "recollect half the dishes for grandmama?  Soup too!  Bless me!  I\n",
       "should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I\n",
       "cannot help beginning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\n",
       "but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited him\n",
       "irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.  He was warm in his\n",
       "reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\n",
       "pleasure.  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\n",
       "she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely\n",
       "glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\n",
       "Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\n",
       "alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\n",
       "peculiarly gratifying.  The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\n",
       "minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\n",
       "occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\n",
       "to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.-- From\n",
       "Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted\n",
       "the ballroom, she had strong hopes.  It seemed as if her eyes were\n",
       "suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the\n",
       "superior creature she had believed him.  The fever was over, and Emma\n",
       "could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by\n",
       "injurious courtesy.  She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons\n",
       "for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be\n",
       "farther requisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in\n",
       "love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy\n",
       "a summer must be before her!\n",
       "\n",
       "She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.  He had told her that\n",
       "he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he\n",
       "was to be at home by the middle of the day.  She did not regret it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them\n",
       "all to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened\n",
       "up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their\n",
       "grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons\n",
       "entered whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank\n",
       "Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment\n",
       "sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.\n",
       "Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--\n",
       "The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they\n",
       "were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a\n",
       "chair fainted away.\n",
       "\n",
       "A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\n",
       "and surprizes be explained.  Such events are very interesting, but the\n",
       "suspense of them cannot last long.  A few minutes made Emma acquainted\n",
       "with the whole.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\n",
       "Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\n",
       "taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\n",
       "for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond\n",
       "Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side,\n",
       "it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young\n",
       "ladies had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a\n",
       "small distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the\n",
       "side, a party of gipsies.  A child on the watch, came towards them to\n",
       "beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream,\n",
       "and calling on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a\n",
       "slight hedge at the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut\n",
       "back to Highbury.  But poor Harriet could not follow.  She had suffered\n",
       "very much from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the\n",
       "bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--\n",
       "and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to\n",
       "remain.\n",
       "\n",
       "How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\n",
       "courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\n",
       "not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen\n",
       "children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and\n",
       "impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more\n",
       "frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out her\n",
       "purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to\n",
       "use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was\n",
       "moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting, and she\n",
       "was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\n",
       "conditioning, they loud and insolent.  By a most fortunate chance his\n",
       "leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\n",
       "at this critical moment.  The pleasantness of the morning had induced\n",
       "him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\n",
       "a mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair\n",
       "of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\n",

       "\n",

       "fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and\n",
       "quite undesignedly.  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which\n",
       "made the information she received more valuable.  She merely said, in\n",
       "the course of some trivial chat, \"Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I\n",
       "would advise you to do so and so\"--and thought no more of it, till\n",

       "hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had\n",
       "been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she\n",
       "was perfectly resolved.-- She believed it would be wiser for her to say\n",
       "and know at once, all that she meant to say and know.  Plain dealing\n",
       "was always best.  She had previously determined how far she would\n",
       "proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for\n",
       "both, to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with\n",
       "speed.-- She was decided, and thus spoke--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.  Your\n",
       "resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\n",

       "not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you.\n",

       "very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken\n",

       "acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry\n",
       "herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\n",
       "ourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\n",

       "words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.  The\n",
       "quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse,\n",

       "Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in\n",

       "pushed away.  If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\n",
       "buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\n",
       "looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\n",

       "demure.  He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly\n",
       "entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to\n",

       "It was done however.  This gallant young man, who seemed to love\n",
       "without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,\n",

       "degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.  Mr. Knightley's\n",
       "excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize\n",
       "every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was not\n",
       "long before he saw it to be _Dixon_.  Jane Fairfax's perception seemed\n",
       "to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the\n",

       "watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?\" she cried.--\"And such weather\n",
       "for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious.\n",
       "What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing\n",
       "done.  Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\n",
       "exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You had better explore to Donwell,\" replied Mr. Knightley.  \"That may\n",
       "be done without horses.  Come, and eat my strawberries.  They are\n",
       "ripening fast.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\n",
       "for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \"Oh!  I should\n",
       "like it of all things,\" was not plainer in words than manner.  Donwell\n",
       "was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the\n",
       "invitation:  but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been\n",
       "enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.  She\n",
       "promised him again and again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and\n",
       "was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a\n",
       "distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may depend upon me,\" said she.  \"I certainly will come.  Name your\n",
       "day, and I will come.  You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot name a day,\" said he, \"till I have spoken to some others whom\n",
       "I would wish to meet you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! leave all that to me.  Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am Lady\n",
       "Patroness, you know.  It is my party.  I will bring friends with me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope you will bring Elton,\" said he:  \"but I will not trouble you to\n",
       "give any other invitations.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! now you are looking very sly.  But consider--you need not be\n",
       "afraid of delegating power to _me_.  I am no young lady on her\n",
       "preferment.  Married women, you know, may be safely authorised.  It is\n",
       "my party.  Leave it all to me.  I will invite your guests.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\"--he calmly replied,--\"there is but one married woman in the world\n",
       "whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\n",
       "that one is--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such\n",
       "matters myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah! you are an odd creature!\" she cried, satisfied to have no one\n",
       "preferred to herself.--\"You are a humourist, and may say what you like.\n",
       "Quite a humourist.  Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her\n",
       "aunt.--The rest I leave to you.  I have no objections at all to meeting\n",
       "the Hartfield family.  Don't scruple.  I know you are attached to them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on\n",
       "Miss Bates in my way home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.  It\n",
       "is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.\n",
       "I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\n",
       "on my arm.  Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.  Nothing can\n",
       "be more simple, you see.  And Jane will have such another.  There is to\n",
       "be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.  We are to walk about your\n",
       "gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\n",
       "trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\n",
       "of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.  Every thing as\n",
       "natural and simple as possible.  Is not that your idea?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not quite.  My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the\n",
       "table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\n",
       "gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\n",
       "best observed by meals within doors.  When you are tired of eating\n",
       "strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out.  And, by the\n",
       "bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--\n",
       "Pray be sincere, Knightley.  If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or\n",
       "to inspect anything--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is\n",
       "extremely clever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\n",
       "would spurn any body's assistance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish we had a donkey.  The thing would be for us all to come on\n",
       "donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by.  I\n",
       "really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.  In a country life I\n",
       "conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so\n",
       "many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\n",
       "home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in\n",
       "winter there is dirt.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.  Donwell Lane\n",
       "is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.  Come on a donkey,\n",
       "however, if you prefer it.  You can borrow Mrs. Cole's.  I would wish\n",
       "every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That I am sure you would.  Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\n",
       "Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\n",
       "warmest heart.  As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.-- Yes,\n",
       "believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\n",
       "the whole of this scheme.  You have hit upon the very thing to please\n",
       "me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.  He\n",
       "wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\n",
       "and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat\n",
       "would inevitably make him ill.  Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\n",
       "specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\n",
       "Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was invited on good faith.  No lurking horrors were to upbraid him\n",
       "for his easy credulity.  He did consent.  He had not been at Donwell\n",
       "for two years.  \"Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet,\n",
       "could go very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the\n",
       "dear girls walked about the gardens.  He did not suppose they could be\n",
       "damp now, in the middle of the day.  He should like to see the old\n",
       "house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs.\n",
       "Elton, and any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection\n",
       "at all to his, and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine\n",
       "morning.  He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite\n",
       "them--very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was\n",
       "not fond of dining out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.\n",
       "The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,\n",
       "like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular\n",
       "compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high\n",
       "expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to\n",
       "get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and\n",
       "gratitude which could have been dispensed with.-- Mr. Knightley was\n",
       "then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston\n",
       "engaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments to induce\n",
       "him to come.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\n",
       "Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\n",
       "settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing\n",
       "exactly right.\n",
       "\n",
       "Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\n",
       "safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\n",
       "this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\n",
       "Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\n",
       "happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\n",
       "had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\n",
       "to heat themselves.-- Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\n",
       "purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all\n",
       "the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\n",
       "sympathiser.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she\n",
       "was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him, and\n",
       "look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more\n",
       "particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds\n",
       "which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\n",
       "\n",
       "She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\n",
       "the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\n",
       "the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\n",
       "characteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens\n",
       "stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\n",
       "all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its\n",
       "abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor\n",
       "extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and\n",
       "totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and\n",
       "irregular, with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It\n",
       "was just what it ought to be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt\n",
       "an increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such true\n",
       "gentility, untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper\n",
       "John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.\n",
       "She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise\n",
       "a blush.  These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and\n",
       "indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and\n",
       "collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,\n",
       "excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;\n",
       "and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and\n",
       "her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\n",
       "talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\n",
       "spoken of.--\"The best fruit in England--every body's favourite--always\n",
       "wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to\n",
       "gather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning\n",
       "decidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboy\n",
       "infinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly\n",
       "eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest\n",
       "flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--abundance about\n",
       "Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners\n",
       "thinking exactly different--no general rule--gardeners never to be put\n",
       "out of their way--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much\n",
       "of--inferior to cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to\n",

       "bear it no longer--must go and sit in the shade.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by\n",
       "Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\n",
       "inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.-- She had some\n",
       "fears of his horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to\n",
       "overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.-- A\n",
       "situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.  Mrs. Elton had\n",
       "received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.  It was not\n",
       "with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and\n",
       "splendour it fell short only of them:  it was with a cousin of Mrs.\n",
       "Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.\n",
       "Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,\n",
       "every thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\n",
       "immediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she\n",
       "positively refused to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax\n",
       "continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\n",
       "thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\n",
       "before.-- Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\n",
       "acquiescence by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was\n",
       "astonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and\n",
       "at last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\n",
       "removal.-- \"Should not they walk?  Would not Mr. Knightley shew them\n",
       "the gardens--all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole\n",
       "extent.\"--The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a\n",
       "scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly\n",
       "followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of\n",
       "limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the\n",
       "river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.-- It led to nothing;\n",
       "nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars,\n",
       "which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an\n",
       "approach to the house, which never had been there.  Disputable,\n",
       "however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself\n",
       "a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty.--The\n",
       "considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood,\n",
       "gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a\n",
       "mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well\n",
       "clothed with wood;--and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed\n",
       "and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the\n",
       "river making a close and handsome curve around it.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.  English verdure,\n",
       "English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without\n",
       "being oppressive.\n",
       "\n",
       "In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\n",
       "towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\n",
       "distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.  Mr. Knightley and\n",
       "Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--There\n",
       "had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\n",
       "turned from her with little ceremony.  Now they seemed in pleasant\n",
       "conversation.  There had been a time also when Emma would have been\n",
       "sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm;\n",
       "but now she feared it not.  It might be safely viewed with all its\n",
       "appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading\n",
       "flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She\n",
       "joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in\n",
       "looking around.  He was giving Harriet information as to modes of\n",
       "agriculture, etc.  and Emma received a smile which seemed to say,\n",
       "\"These are my own concerns.  I have a right to talk on such subjects,\n",
       "without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin.\"--She did not\n",
       "suspect him.  It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably\n",
       "ceased to think of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the\n",
       "walk.--The shade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest\n",
       "part of the day.\n",
       "\n",
       "The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and\n",
       "they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come.\n",
       "Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.  His father would not own\n",
       "himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of\n",
       "wishing that he would part with his black mare.  He had expressed\n",
       "himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.  \"His aunt was\n",
       "so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.\"--Mrs.\n",
       "Churchill's state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was\n",
       "liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the\n",
       "most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to\n",
       "believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill\n",
       "that he was prevented coming.-- Emma looked at Harriet while the point\n",
       "was under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\n",
       "what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as\n",
       "far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\n",
       "any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.\n",
       "Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\n",
       "of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by\n",
       "him, stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him,\n",
       "that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise\n",
       "and variety which her spirits seemed to need.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's\n",
       "entertainment.  Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\n",
       "shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\n",
       "prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the\n",
       "kindness had perfectly answered.  Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly\n",
       "well amused.  Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he\n",
       "would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance\n",
       "to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was\n",
       "slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking over was\n",
       "begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few\n",
       "moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the\n",
       "house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly\n",
       "in from the garden, and with a look of escape.-- Little expecting to\n",
       "meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will you be so kind,\" said she, \"when I am missed, as to say that I am\n",

       "is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted,\n",
       "and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to\n",
       "any body.  It would only be giving trouble and distress.  Some are gone\n",
       "to the ponds, and some to the lime walk.  Till they all come in I shall\n",
       "not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that\n",

       "safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\n",
       "time.  Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\n",
       "the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.  Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\n",
       "Woodhouse.  Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\n",
       "Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\n",
       "had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\n",
       "of the day there was deficiency.  There was a languor, a want of\n",
       "spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over.  They separated\n",
       "too much into parties.  The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took\n",

       "Churchill.  And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise\n",
       "better.  It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never\n",
       "materially varied.  Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness\n",
       "to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole\n",
       "hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of\n",

       "When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\n",

       "was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the\n",
       "admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most\n",
       "animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own\n",

       "flirtation could very well describe.  \"Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\n",

       "right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only\n",
       "requires something very entertaining from each of you, in a general\n",
       "way.  Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to\n",

       "indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily at them all.\"\n",

       "his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be\n",
       "possible.  Mrs. Weston wants to see you.  She must see you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is she unwell?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.  She would have ordered\n",
       "the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that\n",
       "you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly.  This moment, if you please.  It is impossible to refuse\n",
       "what you ask in such a way.  But what can be the matter?-- Is she\n",
       "really not ill?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.  You will know it all in\n",
       "time.  The most unaccountable business!  But hush, hush!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.  Something\n",
       "really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\n",
       "well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her\n",
       "father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon\n",
       "out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now,\"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--\"now\n",
       "Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no,\"--he gravely replied.--\"Don't ask me.  I promised my wife to\n",
       "leave it all to her.  She will break it to you better than I can.  Do\n",
       "not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Break it to me,\" cried Emma, standing still with terror.-- \"Good\n",
       "God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick\n",
       "Square.  I know it has.  Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what\n",
       "it is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, indeed you are mistaken.\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\n",
       "friends are now in Brunswick Square.  Which of them is it?-- I charge\n",
       "you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word, Emma.\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that\n",
       "it has nothing to do with any of them?  Good Heavens!--What can be to\n",
       "be _broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my honour,\" said he very seriously, \"it does not.  It is not in\n",
       "the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\n",
       "Knightley.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was wrong,\" he continued, \"in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\n",
       "I should not have used the expression.  In fact, it does not concern\n",
       "you--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my\n",
       "dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.  I don't say\n",
       "that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much\n",
       "worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.  She\n",
       "asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\n",
       "that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\n",
       "concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\n",
       "circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at\n",
       "Richmond had brought forward.  Her fancy was very active.  Half a dozen\n",
       "natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!-- This, though very\n",
       "undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.  It inspired little\n",
       "more than an animating curiosity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who is that gentleman on horseback?\" said she, as they proceeded--\n",
       "speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with any\n",
       "other view.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I\n",
       "assure you.  You will not see him.  He is half way to Windsor by this\n",
       "time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Has your son been with you, then?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\n",
       "and demure,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\"Well, my dear,\" said\n",
       "he, as they entered the room--\"I have brought her, and now I hope you\n",
       "will soon be better.  I shall leave you together.  There is no use in\n",
       "delay.  I shall not be far off, if you want me.\"-- And Emma distinctly\n",
       "heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--\"I have\n",
       "been as good as my word.  She has not the least idea.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\n",
       "that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\n",
       "eagerly said,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is it my dear friend?  Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\n",
       "find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is.  I have been\n",
       "walking all this way in complete suspense.  We both abhor suspense.  Do\n",
       "not let mine continue longer.  It will do you good to speak of your\n",
       "distress, whatever it may be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have you indeed no idea?\" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\n",
       "\"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are\n",
       "to hear?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are right.  It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\"\n",
       "(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) \"He has\n",
       "been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand.  It is\n",
       "impossible to express our surprize.  He came to speak to his father on\n",
       "a subject,--to announce an attachment--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She stopped to breathe.  Emma thought first of herself, and then of\n",
       "Harriet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"More than an attachment, indeed,\" resumed Mrs. Weston; \"an\n",
       "engagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will\n",
       "any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax\n",
       "are engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!  You are not serious?  You do not mean it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may well be amazed,\" returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her\n",
       "eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to\n",
       "recover-- \"You may well be amazed.  But it is even so.  There has been\n",
       "a solemn engagement between them ever since October--formed at\n",
       "Weymouth, and kept a secret from every body.  Not a creature knowing it\n",
       "but themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.-- It is\n",
       "so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet\n",
       "almost incredible to myself.  I can hardly believe it.-- I thought I\n",
       "knew him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two\n",
       "ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\n",
       "poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\n",
       "confirmation, repeated confirmation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said she at last, trying to recover herself; \"this is a\n",
       "circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\n",
       "all comprehend it.  What!--engaged to her all the winter--before\n",
       "either of them came to Highbury?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very\n",
       "much.  It has hurt his father equally.  _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\n",
       "cannot excuse.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, \"I will not pretend _not_ to\n",
       "understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\n",
       "that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\n",
       "apprehensive of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as\n",
       "steady as her words.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\n",
       "present perfect indifference,\" she continued, \"I will farther tell you,\n",
       "that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\n",
       "did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,\n",
       "was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\n",
       "Fortunately, however, it did cease.  I have really for some time past,\n",
       "for at least these three months, cared nothing about him.  You may\n",
       "believe me, Mrs. Weston.  This is the simple truth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\n",
       "utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\n",
       "than any thing else in the world could do.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\" said she.  \"On\n",
       "this point we have been wretched.  It was our darling wish that you\n",
       "might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was\n",
       "so.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\n",
       "wonder to you and myself.  But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\n",
       "and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.  What right had he\n",
       "to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so\n",
       "_very_ disengaged?  What right had he to endeavour to please, as he\n",
       "certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\n",
       "attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to\n",
       "another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?-- How\n",
       "could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very\n",
       "wrong, very wrong indeed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!  Composure with a witness!\n",
       "to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\n",
       "before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\n",
       "which I can neither comprehend nor respect.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\n",
       "He had not time to enter into much explanation.  He was here only a\n",
       "quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the\n",
       "full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had been\n",
       "misunderstandings he decidedly said.  The present crisis, indeed,\n",
       "seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\n",
       "possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Impropriety!  Oh!  Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.  Much, much\n",
       "beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\n",
       "in my opinion.  So unlike what a man should be!-- None of that upright\n",
       "integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain\n",
       "of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every\n",
       "transaction of his life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\n",
       "in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\n",
       "many, very many, good qualities; and--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good God!\" cried Emma, not attending to her.--\"Mrs. Smallridge, too!\n",
       "Jane actually on the point of going as governess!  What could he mean\n",
       "by such horrible indelicacy?  To suffer her to engage herself--to\n",
       "suffer her even to think of such a measure!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He knew nothing about it, Emma.  On this article I can fully acquit\n",
       "him.  It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--or\n",
       "at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.-- Till\n",
       "yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.  They\n",
       "burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--and it\n",
       "was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers,\n",
       "which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle,\n",
       "throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the\n",
       "miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma began to listen better.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am to hear from him soon,\" continued Mrs. Weston.  \"He told me at\n",
       "parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\n",
       "seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.  Let\n",
       "us wait, therefore, for this letter.  It may bring many extenuations.\n",
       "It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to\n",
       "be understood.  Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to\n",
       "condemn him.  Let us have patience.  I must love him; and now that I am\n",
       "satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\n",
       "for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may.  They must\n",
       "both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\n",
       "concealment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_His_ sufferings,\" replied Emma dryly, \"do not appear to have done him\n",
       "much harm.  Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely a\n",
       "difficulty.  Conceive what the events of a week have done in that\n",
       "family!  While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not\n",
       "have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her\n",
       "remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to\n",
       "act exactly opposite to what she would have required.  What a blessing\n",
       "it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!-- He gave his\n",
       "consent with very little persuasion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah!\" thought Emma, \"he would have done as much for Harriet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\n",
       "morning.  He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some\n",
       "time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to\n",
       "his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I\n",
       "tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.-- He was very\n",
       "much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear\n",
       "quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him\n",
       "before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of\n",
       "finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--\n",
       "and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with\n",
       "such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know\n",
       "of the engagement?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"None; not one.  He positively said that it had been known to no being\n",
       "in the world but their two selves.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Emma, \"I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\n",
       "idea, and I wish them very happy.  But I shall always think it a very\n",
       "abominable sort of proceeding.  What has it been but a system of\n",
       "hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?-- To come among us\n",
       "with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in\n",
       "secret to judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and\n",
       "spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of\n",
       "truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\n",
       "carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\n",
       "words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the\n",
       "consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\n",
       "perfectly agreeable!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am quite easy on that head,\" replied Mrs. Weston.  \"I am very sure\n",
       "that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might\n",
       "not have heard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\n",
       "imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"True.  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\n",
       "Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\n",
       "as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the\n",
       "window, evidently on the watch.  His wife gave him a look which invited\n",
       "him in; and, while he was coming round, added, \"Now, dearest Emma, let\n",
       "me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at\n",
       "ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.  Let us make the\n",
       "best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her\n",
       "favour.  It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does\n",
       "not feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate\n",
       "circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached\n",
       "himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as\n",
       "I have always given her credit for--and still am disposed to give her\n",
       "credit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule\n",
       "of right.  And how much may be said in her situation for even that\n",
       "error!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Much, indeed!\" cried Emma feelingly.  \"If a woman can ever be excused\n",
       "for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\n",
       "Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not\n",
       "their's, nor the world's law.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\n",
       "exclaiming,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!  This was\n",
       "a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent\n",
       "of guessing.  But you really frightened me.  I thought you had lost\n",
       "half your property, at least.  And here, instead of its being a matter\n",
       "of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I\n",
       "congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of\n",
       "having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England\n",
       "for your daughter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\n",
       "right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits\n",
       "was immediate.  His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he\n",
       "shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the\n",
       "subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and\n",
       "persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.  His companions\n",
       "suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections;\n",
       "and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked\n",
       "it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was\n",
       "become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best\n",
       "thing that Frank could possibly have done.\n",

       "\"Harriet, poor Harriet!\"--Those were the words; in them lay the\n",
       "tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\n",
       "the real misery of the business to her.  Frank Churchill had behaved\n",
       "very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much\n",
       "_his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him.  It was\n",
       "the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave\n",
       "the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the\n",
       "dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.  Mr. Knightley had spoken\n",
       "prophetically, when he once said, \"Emma, you have been no friend to\n",
       "Harriet Smith.\"--She was afraid she had done her nothing but\n",
       "disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\n",
       "instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\n",
       "the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\n",
       "never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\n",
       "her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\n",
       "given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of\n",
       "having encouraged what she might have repressed.  She might have\n",
       "prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.  Her\n",
       "influence would have been enough.  And now she was very conscious that\n",
       "she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking\n",
       "her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.  Common sense\n",
       "would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow\n",
       "herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to\n",
       "one against his ever caring for her.--\"But, with common sense,\" she\n",
       "added, \"I am afraid I have had little to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was extremely angry with herself.  If she could not have been angry\n",
       "with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.-- As for Jane\n",
       "Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\n",
       "solicitude on her account.  Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need\n",
       "no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\n",
       "having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her\n",
       "days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and\n",
       "happy, and prosperous.-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\n",
       "had been slighted.  This discovery laid many smaller matters open.  No\n",
       "doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival;\n",
       "and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\n",
       "repulsed.  An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the\n",
       "rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.\n",
       "She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself\n",
       "from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged\n",
       "that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\n",
       "desert.  But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!  There was\n",
       "little sympathy to be spared for any body else.  Emma was sadly fearful\n",
       "that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\n",
       "Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\n",
       "judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing\n",
       "reserve and self-command, it would.-- She must communicate the painful\n",
       "truth, however, and as soon as possible.  An injunction of secresy had\n",
       "been among Mr. Weston's parting words.  \"For the present, the whole\n",
       "affair was to be completely a secret.  Mr. Churchill had made a point\n",
       "of it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\n",
       "and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\"-- Emma had\n",
       "promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.  It was her superior duty.\n",
       "\n",
       "In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\n",
       "ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\n",
       "office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through\n",
       "by herself.  The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to\n",
       "her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another.  Her heart beat\n",
       "quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had\n",
       "poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.  Could the\n",
       "event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!-- But of that,\n",
       "unfortunately, there could be no chance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Miss Woodhouse!\" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\n",
       "\"is not this the oddest news that ever was?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What news do you mean?\" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\n",
       "voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"About Jane Fairfax.  Did you ever hear any thing so strange?  Oh!--you\n",
       "need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\n",
       "himself.  I met him just now.  He told me it was to be a great secret;\n",
       "and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but\n",
       "you, but he said you knew it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What did Mr. Weston tell you?\"--said Emma, still perplexed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\n",
       "are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\n",
       "another this long while.  How very odd!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that\n",
       "Emma did not know how to understand it.  Her character appeared\n",
       "absolutely changed.  She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\n",
       "disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.  Emma looked at\n",
       "her, quite unable to speak.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Had you any idea,\" cried Harriet, \"of his being in love with\n",
       "her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see\n",
       "into every body's heart; but nobody else--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Upon my word,\" said Emma, \"I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\n",
       "Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached to\n",
       "another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--\n",
       "encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the\n",
       "slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\n",
       "Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.  You may be very\n",
       "sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Me!\" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.  \"Why should you\n",
       "caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\" replied\n",
       "Emma, smiling; \"but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and\n",
       "not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you\n",
       "did care about him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Him!--never, never.  Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake\n",
       "me?\" turning away distressed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--\"What do you mean?--\n",
       "Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat\n",
       "down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\n",
       "her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\n",
       "in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I should not have thought it possible,\" she began, \"that you could\n",
       "have misunderstood me!  I know we agreed never to name him--but\n",
       "considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should\n",
       "not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other\n",
       "person.  Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!  I do not know who would ever\n",
       "look at him in the company of the other.  I hope I have a better taste\n",
       "than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side.\n",
       "And that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but\n",
       "for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in\n",
       "my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a\n",
       "presumption almost, to dare to think of him.  At first, if you had not\n",
       "told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been\n",
       "matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);-- I should\n",
       "not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought it\n",
       "possible--But if _you_, who had been always acquainted with him--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Harriet!\" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\"Let us\n",
       "understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.\n",
       "Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To be sure I am.  I never could have an idea of any body else--and so\n",
       "I thought you knew.  When we talked about him, it was as clear as\n",
       "possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not quite,\" returned Emma, with forced calmness, \"for all that you\n",
       "then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.  I could\n",
       "almost assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill.  I am sure the\n",
       "service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from\n",
       "the gipsies, was spoken of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!  Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\n",
       "the occasion.  I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;\n",
       "that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\n",
       "natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\n",
       "your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations\n",
       "had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of\n",
       "it is strong on my memory.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, dear,\" cried Harriet, \"now I recollect what you mean; but I was\n",
       "thinking of something very different at the time.  It was not the\n",
       "gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.  No! (with some\n",
       "elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.\n",
       "Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\n",
       "stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room.\n",
       "That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and\n",
       "generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how\n",
       "superior he was to every other being upon earth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good God!\" cried Emma, \"this has been a most unfortunate--most\n",
       "deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?  At\n",
       "least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\n",
       "other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She paused a few moments.  Emma could not speak.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\" she resumed, \"that you should feel a\n",
       "great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.  You must\n",
       "think one five hundred million times more above me than the other.  But\n",
       "I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may\n",
       "appear--.  But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\n",
       "things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place\n",
       "than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if\n",
       "such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should\n",
       "be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should\n",
       "really--if _he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put\n",
       "difficulties in the way.  But you are too good for that, I am sure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet was standing at one of the windows.  Emma turned round to look\n",
       "at her in consternation, and hastily said,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\"I must say that I\n",
       "have.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\n",
       "in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.  A few minutes were sufficient\n",
       "for making her acquainted with her own heart.  A mind like hers, once\n",
       "opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.  She touched--she\n",
       "admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.  Why was it so much worse\n",
       "that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank\n",
       "Churchill?  Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's\n",
       "having some hope of a return?  It darted through her, with the speed of\n",
       "an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!\n",
       "\n",
       "Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\n",
       "few minutes.  She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\n",
       "her before.  How improperly had she been acting by Harriet!  How\n",
       "inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\n",
       "her conduct!  What blindness, what madness, had led her on!  It struck\n",
       "her with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in\n",
       "the world.  Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of\n",
       "all these demerits--some concern for her own appearance, and a strong\n",
       "sense of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to\n",
       "the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice\n",
       "required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave\n",
       "Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even\n",
       "apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the\n",
       "utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet\n",
       "had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so\n",
       "voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the\n",
       "person, whose counsels had never led her right.-- Rousing from\n",
       "reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet\n",
       "again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as\n",
       "to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of\n",
       "Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.-- Neither of them thought\n",
       "but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\n",
       "to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,\n",
       "and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to\n",
       "give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling\n",
       "delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were\n",
       "better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.  Her voice was\n",
       "not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a\n",
       "development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion\n",
       "of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.-- She listened with\n",
       "much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet's\n",
       "detail.--Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could\n",
       "not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the\n",
       "feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her\n",
       "spirit--especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own\n",
       "memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of\n",
       "Harriet.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\n",
       "those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\n",
       "found her much superior to his expectation.  From that evening, or at\n",
       "least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of\n",
       "him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more\n",
       "than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different\n",
       "manner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she\n",
       "had been more and more aware of it.  When they had been all walking\n",
       "together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\n",
       "delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her.  Emma knew\n",
       "it to have been very much the case.  She had often observed the change,\n",
       "to almost the same extent.-- Harriet repeated expressions of\n",
       "approbation and praise from him--and Emma felt them to be in the\n",
       "closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet.\n",
       "He praised her for being without art or affectation, for having simple,\n",
       "honest, generous, feelings.-- She knew that he saw such recommendations\n",
       "in Harriet; he had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that\n",
       "lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice she\n",
       "had received from him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to\n",
       "another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been\n",
       "unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma.  Circumstances that might\n",
       "swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied proofs to\n",
       "her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her who now heard\n",
       "them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of\n",
       "strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness\n",
       "from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking with her apart from the\n",
       "others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some\n",
       "time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to\n",
       "draw her from the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her\n",
       "in a more particular way than he had ever done before, in a very\n",
       "particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.)\n",
       "He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her affections were\n",
       "engaged.-- But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join\n",
       "them, he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:-- The\n",
       "second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before\n",
       "Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his being at\n",
       "Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said that he could not\n",
       "stay five minutes--and his having told her, during their conversation,\n",
       "that though he must go to London, it was very much against his\n",
       "inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as Emma\n",
       "felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_.  The superior degree of\n",
       "confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her\n",
       "severe pain.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\n",
       "little reflection, venture the following question.  \"Might he not?--Is\n",
       "not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\n",
       "your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he might have Mr.\n",
       "Martin's interest in view?  But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\n",
       "spirit.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Martin!  No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.  I hope I\n",
       "know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\n",
       "Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I never should have presumed to think of it at first,\" said she, \"but\n",
       "for you.  You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour\n",
       "be the rule of mine--and so I have.  But now I seem to feel that I may\n",
       "deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\n",
       "very wonderful.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter\n",
       "feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable\n",
       "her to say on reply,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the\n",
       "last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea\n",
       "of his feeling for her more than he really does.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\n",
       "satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\n",
       "at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\n",
       "father's footsteps.  He was coming through the hall.  Harriet was too\n",
       "much agitated to encounter him.  \"She could not compose herself-- Mr.\n",
       "Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;\"--with most ready\n",
       "encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through\n",

       "declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the\n",
       "course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,\n",
       "overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on\n",
       "the important subject.  Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence\n",
       "in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude\n",
       "she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily\n",
       "open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a\n",
       "good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement.\n",
       "Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest\n",
       "relief to her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had\n",
       "so long been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on\n",
       "the subject.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\n",
       "many months,\" continued Mrs. Weston, \"she was energetic.  This was one\n",
       "of her expressions.  'I will not say, that since I entered into the\n",
       "engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I\n",
       "have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the\n",

       "at my heart.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor girl!\" said Emma.  \"She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Wrong!  No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed to\n",
       "blame herself.  'The consequence,' said she, 'has been a state of\n",
       "perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.  But after all the\n",
       "punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.\n",
       "Pain is no expiation.  I never can be blameless.  I have been acting\n",
       "contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every\n",
       "thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my\n",
       "conscience tells me ought not to be.'  'Do not imagine, madam,' she\n",
       "continued, 'that I was taught wrong.  Do not let any reflection fall on\n",
       "the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up.  The error\n",
       "has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that\n",

       "story known to Colonel Campbell.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor girl!\" said Emma again.  \"She loves him then excessively, I\n",
       "suppose.  It must have been from attachment only, that she could be led\n",
       "to form the engagement.  Her affection must have overpowered her\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am afraid,\" returned Emma, sighing, \"that I must often have\n",
       "contributed to make her unhappy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.  But she probably\n",
       "had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\n",
       "misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.  One natural\n",
       "consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\" she said, \"was\n",
       "that of making her _unreasonable_.  The consciousness of having done\n",
       "amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\n",
       "and irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for\n",
       "him to bear.  'I did not make the allowances,' said she, 'which I ought\n",
       "to have done, for his temper and spirits--his delightful spirits, and\n",
       "that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\n",
       "circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\n",
       "me, as they were at first.' She then began to speak of you, and of the\n",
       "great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\n",
       "which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an\n",
       "opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every\n",
       "wish and every endeavour to do her good.  She was sensible that you had\n",
       "never received any proper acknowledgment from herself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I did not know her to be happy now,\" said Emma, seriously, \"which,\n",
       "in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\n",
       "must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!  Mrs. Weston, if\n",
       "there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done\n",
       "Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively),\n",
       "this is all to be forgotten.  You are very kind to bring me these\n",
       "interesting particulars.  They shew her to the greatest advantage.  I\n",
       "am sure she is very good--I hope she will be very happy.  It is fit\n",
       "that the fortune should be on his side, for I think the merit will be\n",
       "all on hers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston.  She\n",
       "thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she\n",
       "loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.  She\n",
       "talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but\n",
       "she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to\n",
       "Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and\n",
       "when Mrs. Weston ended with, \"We have not yet had the letter we are so\n",
       "anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,\" she was obliged\n",
       "to pause before she answered, and at last obliged to answer at random,\n",

       "anxious for.\n",

       "intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for\n",
       "unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\n",
       "sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.  She bitterly regretted\n",
       "not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\n",
       "envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\n",
       "Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention\n",
       "to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\n",
       "better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to\n",
       "find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\n",
       "probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\n",
       "now.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\n",

       "confidence on this important matter--which was most probable--still,\n",
       "in knowing her as she ought, and as she might, she must have been\n",
       "preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to\n",
       "Mr. Dixon, which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured\n",
       "herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly\n",
       "feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of\n",

       "Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to\n",

       "She must have been a perpetual enemy.  They never could have been all\n",
       "three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a\n",

       "by exertions which had never cost her half so much before.  It reminded\n",
       "her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's\n",
       "wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and\n",
       "dissipated every melancholy fancy.  Alas! such delightful proofs of\n",
       "Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\n",
       "be over.  The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\n",
       "approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\n",
       "no pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared\n",
       "would experience no similar contradiction.  The prospect before her\n",
       "now, was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--\n",
       "that might not be even partially brightened.  If all took place that\n",
       "might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\n",
       "comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\n",
       "spirits only of ruined happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\n",
       "herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.\n",
       "They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\n",
       "also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\n",
       "Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\n",
       "Highbury.  They would be married, and settled either at or near\n",
       "Enscombe.  All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these\n",
       "losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of\n",
       "cheerful or of rational society within their reach?  Mr. Knightley to\n",
       "be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!-- No longer walking\n",
       "in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for\n",
       "their's!--How was it to be endured?  And if he were to be lost to them\n",
       "for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding\n",
       "in Harriet's society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the\n",
       "chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked\n",
       "for all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasing\n",
       "Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind,\n",
       "that it had been all her own work?\n",
       "\n",
       "When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\n",
       "a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few\n",
       "seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation or\n",
       "composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\n",
       "conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\n",
       "be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\n",
       "would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the\n",
       "same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\n",
       "Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\n",
       "softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\n",
       "summer again.  With all the eagerness which such a transition gives,\n",
       "Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible.  Never had the\n",
       "exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and\n",
       "brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her.  She longed for\n",
       "the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming\n",
       "in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she\n",
       "lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits\n",
       "freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns,\n",
       "when she saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming\n",
       "towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned from\n",
       "London.  She had been thinking of him the moment before, as\n",
       "unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for the\n",
       "quickest arrangement of mind.  She must be collected and calm.  In half\n",
       "a minute they were together.  The \"How d'ye do's\" were quiet and\n",
       "constrained on each side.  She asked after their mutual friends; they\n",
       "were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning.  He must\n",
       "have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her, she found.  \"He\n",
       "had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was not wanted there,\n",
       "preferred being out of doors.\"--She thought he neither looked nor spoke\n",
       "cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her\n",
       "fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his\n",
       "brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.\n",
       "\n",
       "They walked together.  He was silent.  She thought he was often looking\n",
       "at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\n",
       "give.  And this belief produced another dread.  Perhaps he wanted to\n",
       "speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\n",
       "encouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\n",
       "way to any such subject.  He must do it all himself.  Yet she could not\n",
       "bear this silence.  With him it was most unnatural.  She\n",
       "considered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\n",
       "surprize you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have I?\" said he quietly, and looking at her; \"of what nature?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,\n",
       "he replied,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\n",
       "already.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How is it possible?\" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\n",
       "him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\n",
       "at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\n",
       "at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\n",
       "composure,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\n",
       "had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\n",
       "me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voice\n",
       "and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of\n",
       "having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn\n",
       "within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying,\n",
       "in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent\n",
       "sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allow\n",
       "yourself--.\"  Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more broken\n",
       "and subdued accent, \"The feelings of the warmest\n",
       "friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!\"-- And in a louder,\n",
       "steadier tone, he concluded with, \"He will soon be gone.  They will\n",
       "soon be in Yorkshire.  I am sorry for _her_.  She deserves a better\n",
       "fate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\n",
       "of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.-- I\n",
       "am not in want of that sort of compassion.  My blindness to what was\n",
       "going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed\n",
       "of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which\n",
       "may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other\n",
       "reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Emma!\" cried he, looking eagerly at her, \"are you, indeed?\"--but\n",
       "checking himself--\"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased\n",
       "that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! and\n",
       "it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the\n",
       "acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your\n",
       "affections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from\n",
       "your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt-- I could\n",
       "only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference which I\n",
       "never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of\n",
       "man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?-- Jane,\n",
       "Jane, you will be a miserable creature.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--\n",
       "\"I am in a very extraordinary situation.  I cannot let you continue in\n",
       "your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,\n",
       "I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have\n",
       "been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be\n",
       "natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.-- But I\n",
       "never have.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He listened in perfect silence.  She wished him to speak, but he would\n",
       "not.  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\n",
       "clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself\n",
       "in his opinion.  She went on, however.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his\n",
       "attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.-- An old story,\n",
       "probably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of\n",
       "my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets\n",
       "up as I do for Understanding.  Many circumstances assisted the\n",
       "temptation.  He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--I\n",
       "always found him very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me\n",
       "swell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at\n",
       "last--my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his attentions.  Latterly,\n",
       "however--for some time, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning\n",
       "any thing.--I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for\n",
       "seriousness on my side.  He has imposed on me, but he has not injured\n",
       "me.  I have never been attached to him.  And now I can tolerably\n",
       "comprehend his behaviour.  He never wished to attach me.  It was merely\n",
       "a blind to conceal his real situation with another.--It was his object\n",
       "to blind all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more\n",
       "effectually blinded than myself--except that I was _not_ blinded--that\n",
       "it was my good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe\n",
       "from him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\n",
       "conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as\n",
       "she could judge, deep in thought.  At last, and tolerably in his usual\n",
       "tone, he said,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\n",
       "however, that I may have underrated him.  My acquaintance with him has\n",
       "been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\n",
       "may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no\n",
       "motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will be\n",
       "involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\n",
       "well.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no doubt of their being happy together,\" said Emma; \"I believe\n",
       "them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is a most fortunate man!\" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.  \"So\n",
       "early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a\n",
       "wife, he generally chuses ill.  At three-and-twenty to have drawn such\n",
       "a prize!  What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,\n",
       "has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested\n",
       "love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her disinterestedness;\n",
       "every thing in his favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as\n",
       "regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;\n",
       "equality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her\n",
       "heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it\n",
       "will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would\n",
       "always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her\n",
       "from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard,\n",
       "must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed,\n",
       "the favourite of fortune.  Every thing turns out for his good.--He\n",
       "meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection,\n",
       "cannot even weary her by negligent treatment--and had he and all his\n",
       "family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could\n",
       "not have found her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt\n",
       "dies.--He has only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his\n",
       "happiness.-- He had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to\n",
       "forgive him.-- He is a fortunate man indeed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You speak as if you envied him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I do envy him, Emma.  In one respect he is the object of my envy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma could say no more.  They seemed to be within half a sentence of\n",
       "Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\n",
       "possible.  She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\n",
       "different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\n",
       "breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I\n",
       "see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise.\n",
       "Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it\n",
       "unsaid the next moment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,\" she eagerly cried.  \"Take a\n",
       "little time, consider, do not commit yourself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you,\" said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\n",
       "another syllable followed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma could not bear to give him pain.  He was wishing to confide in\n",
       "her--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would\n",
       "listen.  She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she\n",
       "might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own\n",
       "independence, relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be\n",
       "more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had\n",
       "reached the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are going in, I suppose?\" said he.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which\n",
       "he still spoke--\"I should like to take another turn.  Mr. Perry is not\n",
       "gone.\"  And, after proceeding a few steps, she added-- \"I stopped you\n",
       "ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\n",
       "pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or\n",
       "to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as a\n",
       "friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like.  I\n",
       "will tell you exactly what I think.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As a friend!\"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--\"Emma, that I fear is a\n",
       "word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?-- I have\n",
       "gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--\n",
       "Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a\n",
       "friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\n",
       "of his eyes overpowered her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dearest Emma,\" said he, \"for dearest you will always be, whatever\n",
       "the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved\n",
       "Emma--tell me at once.  Say 'No,' if it is to be said.\"-- She could\n",
       "really say nothing.--\"You are silent,\" he cried, with great animation;\n",
       "\"absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.  The\n",
       "dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\n",
       "prominent feeling.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot make speeches, Emma:\"  he soon resumed; and in a tone of such\n",
       "sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\n",
       "convincing.--\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\n",
       "more.  But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I\n",
       "have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\n",
       "woman in England would have borne it.-- Bear with the truths I would\n",
       "tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them.  The\n",
       "manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them.  God knows, I\n",
       "have been a very indifferent lover.-- But you understand me.--Yes, you\n",
       "see, you understand my feelings--and will return them if you can.  At\n",
       "present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\n",
       "velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to\n",
       "catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that\n",
       "Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as\n",
       "complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that\n",
       "she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to\n",
       "Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and\n",
       "that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had\n",
       "been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was\n",
       "there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant\n",
       "happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not\n",
       "escaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was\n",
       "all the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of\n",
       "that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him\n",
       "to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the\n",
       "most worthy of the two--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving\n",
       "to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive,\n",
       "because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not.  She felt for\n",
       "Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run\n",
       "mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her\n",
       "brain.  She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to\n",
       "her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as\n",
       "strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for\n",
       "him, as most unequal and degrading.  Her way was clear, though not\n",
       "quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.-- What did she\n",
       "say?--Just what she ought, of course.  A lady always does.-- She said\n",
       "enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him to say more\n",
       "himself.  He _had_ despaired at one period; he had received such an\n",
       "injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed every\n",
       "hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had perhaps\n",
       "been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn, her\n",
       "renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to, might be a\n",
       "little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley\n",
       "was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human\n",
       "disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little\n",
       "disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the\n",

       "benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the\n",
       "children.-- At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness\n",

       "own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation.  With the\n",
       "greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss\n",

       "deepest humiliation.-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday\n",

       "ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe the declaration, that\n",
       "had I not been convinced of her indifference, I would not have been\n",
       "induced by any selfish views to go on.-- Amiable and delightful as Miss\n",

       "attached; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being\n",
       "attached to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my\n",
       "attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which\n",
       "exactly suited me.  We seemed to understand each other.  From our\n",
       "relative situation, those attentions were her due, and were felt to be\n",
       "so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the\n",
       "expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take\n",
       "leave of her, I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the\n",
       "truth, and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no\n",
       "doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.-- She\n",
       "may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must have penetrated\n",
       "a part.  I cannot doubt it.  You will find, whenever the subject\n",
       "becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take her\n",
       "wholly by surprize.  She frequently gave me hints of it.  I remember\n",
       "her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her\n",
       "attentions to Miss Fairfax.-- I hope this history of my conduct towards\n",
       "her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what\n",
       "you saw amiss.  While you considered me as having sinned against Emma\n",
       "Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either.  Acquit me here, and\n",
       "procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of\n",
       "that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\n",
       "affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\n",
       "myself.-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\n",
       "you have now a key to.  My heart was in Highbury, and my business was\n",
       "to get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least\n",
       "suspicion.  If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right\n",
       "account.-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only\n",
       "necessary to say, that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss\n",
       "F--, who would never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been\n",
       "given her.-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,\n",
       "my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.  You will\n",
       "soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.-- No description\n",
       "can describe her.  She must tell you herself what she is--yet not by\n",
       "word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly\n",
       "suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter, which will be\n",
       "longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.-- She gives a good\n",
       "account of her own health; but as she never complains, I dare not\n",
       "depend.  I want to have your opinion of her looks.  I know you will\n",
       "soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.  Perhaps it is\n",
       "paid already.  Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a\n",
       "thousand particulars.  Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls, and\n",
       "in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still\n",
       "insane either from happiness or misery.  When I think of the kindness\n",
       "and favour I have met with, of her excellence and patience, and my\n",
       "uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy:  but when I recollect all the\n",
       "uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I\n",
       "am mad with anger.  If I could but see her again!--But I must not\n",
       "propose it yet.  My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must\n",
       "still add to this long letter.  You have not heard all that you ought\n",
       "to hear.  I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the\n",
       "suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the\n",
       "affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th\n",
       "ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest\n",
       "prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from\n",
       "the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.\n",
       "I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have\n",
       "felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--\n",
       "But I had no choice.  The hasty engagement she had entered into with\n",
       "that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,\n",
       "to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,\n",
       "and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter what\n",
       "it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect for me.\n",
       "I behaved shamefully.  And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss\n",
       "W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.  _She_\n",
       "disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of\n",
       "concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;\n",
       "I thought unreasonably so:  I thought her, on a thousand occasions,\n",
       "unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:  I thought her even cold.  But\n",
       "she was always right.  If I had followed her judgment, and subdued my\n",
       "spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have escaped\n",
       "the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.-- Do you\n",
       "remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\n",
       "dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.  I was late;\n",
       "I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she\n",
       "would not suffer it.  She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then\n",
       "thought most unreasonable.  Now, however, I see nothing in it but a\n",
       "very natural and consistent degree of discretion.  While I, to blind\n",
       "the world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable\n",
       "particularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a\n",
       "proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we\n",
       "been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must\n",
       "have been suspected.-- I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted\n",
       "her affection.  I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,\n",
       "provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of\n",
       "her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\n",
       "impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment\n",
       "in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.-- In short, my dear\n",
       "madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and\n",
       "I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with\n",
       "you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with her\n",
       "as possible.  Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be\n",
       "reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her\n",
       "coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first\n",
       "advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the\n",
       "Box Hill party.  Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly\n",
       "suppose you would ever have thought well of me again.  Its effect upon\n",
       "her appears in the immediate resolution it produced:  as soon as she\n",
       "found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of\n",
       "that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,\n",
       "by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.  I must not\n",
       "quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended\n",
       "towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the\n",
       "share of it which that woman has known.-- 'Jane,' indeed!--You will\n",
       "observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that\n",

       "for at least a fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's\n",

       "of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted\n",
       "her when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much\n",

       "confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing\n",
       "to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure\n",

       "thrown at this period among those she loved--and the evil should not\n",
       "act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight,\n",
       "at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more\n",
       "agitating, delight, should be hers.\n",
       "\n",
       "She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\n",
       "hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.-- She ought\n",
       "to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\n",
       "situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.  It would be a\n",
       "_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of\n",
       "prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should\n",

       "the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.-- The fear of being\n",
       "still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home,\n",
       "to wait in the passage, and send up her name.-- She heard Patty\n",
       "announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had\n",
       "before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the\n",

       "was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no\n",
       "other reception of her were felt sufficient.-- Emma had never seen her\n",
       "look so well, so lovely, so engaging.  There was consciousness,\n",
       "animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or\n",
       "manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand;\n",

       "immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her own\n",
       "compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old\n",
       "lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery\n",
       "fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss\n",

       "\n",
       "Emma could not doubt.  It was a palpable display, repeated on every\n",

       "Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\" was the abrupt answer, which\n",

       "believe,\" she continued, \"this is the most troublesome parish that ever\n",
       "was.  We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your parish there was small,\" said Jane.\n",

       "the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "a word, if you please.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\n",
       "not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\n",
       "The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\n",
       "evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Elton made his appearance.  His lady greeted him with some of her\n",

       "you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.  You knew I\n",
       "should not stir till my lord and master appeared.-- Here have I been\n",
       "sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\n",
       "obedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\n",
       "His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\n",
       "object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and\n",
       "the walk he had had for nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I got to Donwell,\" said he, \"Knightley could not be found.  Very\n",
       "odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and\n",
       "the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Donwell!\" cried his wife.--\"My dear Mr. E., you have not been to\n",
       "Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\n",
       "to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!-- I\n",
       "went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)\n",
       "which made it so much the worse.  And then not to find him at home!  I\n",
       "assure you I am not at all pleased.  And no apology left, no message\n",
       "for me.  The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being\n",
       "expected.-- Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he\n",
       "was gone.  Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps\n",
       "into his woods.-- Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend\n",
       "Knightley!--Can you explain it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\n",
       "indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot imagine,\" said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\n",
       "ought to do,) \"I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\n",
       "all people in the world!  The very last person whom one should expect\n",
       "to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,\n",
       "I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--\n",
       "and his servants forgot it.  Depend upon it, that was the case: and\n",
       "very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have\n",
       "often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not\n",
       "have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any\n",
       "consideration.  And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap\n",
       "indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I met William Larkins,\" continued Mr. Elton, \"as I got near the house,\n",
       "and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\n",
       "believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.  He did not know\n",
       "what was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever\n",
       "get the speech of him.  I have nothing to do with William's wants, but\n",
       "it really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley\n",
       "to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious\n",
       "inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly.  In all\n",
       "probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\n",
       "Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\n",
       "Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\n",
       "attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\n",
       "an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.  Had you\n",
       "not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\n",
       "introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\n",

       "impertinent.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\n",
       "infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\n",
       "composure--\"there would have been no danger.  The danger would have\n",
       "been of my wearying you.  You could not have gratified me more than by\n",
       "expressing an interest--.  Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\n",
       "collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\n",
       "great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\n",
       "of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\n",
       "disgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could\n",

       "myself.  I feel it so very due.  But, unfortunately--in short, if your\n",
       "compassion does not stand my friend--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\" cried Emma warmly, and\n",
       "taking her hand.  \"You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\n",
       "might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\n",
       "even--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.-- So cold\n",

       "deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Let us forgive each other at once.  We must do whatever is to be done\n",
       "quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.  I hope you\n",

       "The smile was returned as Jane answered,\n",
       "\n",

       "he grew older--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years\n",
       "hence--to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense,\n",
       "the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and\n",
       "Mrs. Weston--no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her;\n",
       "and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to\n",
       "teach, should not have their powers in exercise again.\n",

       "\n",

       "be the only difference.\"\n",

       "\"Poor child!\" cried Emma; \"at that rate, what will become of her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.  She will be disagreeable in\n",
       "infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.  I am losing all my\n",
       "bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma.  I, who am owing\n",
       "all my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me\n",
       "to be severe on them?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma laughed, and replied:  \"But I had the assistance of all your\n",
       "endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.  I doubt\n",
       "whether my own sense would have corrected me without it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you?--I have no doubt.  Nature gave you understanding:-- Miss\n",
       "Taylor gave you principles.  You must have done well.  My interference\n",
       "was quite as likely to do harm as good.  It was very natural for you to\n",
       "say, what right has he to lecture me?--and I am afraid very natural\n",
       "for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner.  I do not\n",
       "believe I did you any good.  The good was all to myself, by making you\n",
       "an object of the tenderest affection to me.  I could not think about\n",
       "you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of\n",
       "fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were\n",
       "thirteen at least.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure you were of use to me,\" cried Emma.  \"I was very often\n",
       "influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.  I am\n",
       "very sure you did me good.  And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\n",
       "spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\n",
       "as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\n",

       "may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I did\n",
       "not approve.  In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\n",
       "feelings instead of one.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"'Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, from\n",
       "habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal.  I\n",
       "want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I remember once calling you 'George,' in one of my amiable fits, about\n",
       "ten years ago.  I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\n",
       "you made no objection, I never did it again.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but 'Mr. Knightley.' I\n",

       "which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\n",
       "follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender\n",
       "a subject.--She could not enter on it.-- Harriet was very seldom\n",
       "mentioned between them.  This, on his side, might merely proceed from\n",
       "her not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it\n",
       "to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their\n",
       "friendship were declining.  She was aware herself, that, parting under\n",
       "any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more,\n",
       "and that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost\n",
       "wholly did, on Isabella's letters.  He might observe that it was so.\n",
       "The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very\n",

       "\n",
       "Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\n",
       "expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,\n",
       "which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be\n",
       "consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear\n",
       "to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--\n",
       "Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had\n",
       "not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped\n",
       "her.  Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by\n",
       "Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month\n",
       "at least.  Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and\n",
       "she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"John does not even mention your friend,\" said Mr. Knightley.  \"Here is\n",
       "his answer, if you like to see it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.  Emma\n",
       "accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to\n",
       "know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that\n",
       "her friend was unmentioned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"John enters like a brother into my happiness,\" continued Mr.\n",

       "making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather\n",
       "cool in her praise.  But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He writes like a sensible man,\" replied Emma, when she had read the\n",
       "letter.  \"I honour his sincerity.  It is very plain that he considers\n",
       "the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is\n",
       "not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection,\n",
       "as you think me already.  Had he said any thing to bear a different\n",

       "and hear his opinion.  Depend upon it, he will be much farther from\n",
       "doing _you_ justice.  He will think all the happiness, all the\n",
       "advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine.  I wish\n",
       "I may not sink into 'poor Emma' with him at once.-- His tender\n",
       "compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah!\" he cried, \"I wish your father might be half as easily convinced\n",
       "as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,\n",
       "to be happy together.  I am amused by one part of John's letter--did\n",
       "you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take him\n",
       "wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing\n",
       "something of the kind.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having some\n",

       "unprepared for that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\n",
       "feelings.  What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any\n",
       "difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this\n",
       "time for my marrying any more than at another.-- But it was so, I\n",
       "suppose.  I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with\n",
       "them the other day.  I believe I did not play with the children quite\n",
       "so much as usual.  I remember one evening the poor boys saying, 'Uncle\n",
       "seems always tired now.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\n",
       "persons' reception of it tried.  As soon as Mrs. Weston was\n",
       "sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it\n",
       "in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,\n",
       "resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.-- But how\n",
       "to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in\n",
       "such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point\n",
       "her heart would have failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr.\n",
       "Knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she\n",
       "was to make.--She was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.\n",
       "She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him, by a\n",
       "melancholy tone herself.  She must not appear to think it a\n",
       "misfortune.--With all the spirits she could command, she prepared him\n",
       "first for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if\n",
       "his consent and approbation could be obtained--which, she trusted,\n",
       "would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote\n",
       "the happiness of all--she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which\n",
       "means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person's\n",
       "company whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,\n",
       "best in the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\n",
       "earnestly to dissuade her from it.  She was reminded, more than once,\n",
       "of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would\n",
       "be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor\n",
       "Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.  Emma hung about\n",
       "him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he\n",
       "must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages\n",
       "taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but\n",
       "she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was\n",
       "introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the\n",
       "better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier\n",
       "for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to\n",
       "the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny\n",
       "that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on\n",
       "business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him, who so ready to\n",

       "attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he like to have him always on\n",
       "the spot?--Yes.  That was all very true.  Mr. Knightley could not be\n",
       "there too often; he should be glad to see him every day;--but they did\n",
       "see him every day as it was.--Why could not they go on as they had done?\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\n",
       "the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--\n",
       "To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose\n",
       "fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was\n",
       "soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.-- They had\n",
       "all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the\n",
       "strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting,\n",
       "to consider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a\n",
       "settled, and, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal\n",
       "importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was\n",
       "agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to\n",

       "some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that\n",

       "said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\n",
       "never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\n",
       "saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\n",
       "urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\n",
       "to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\n",
       "so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\n",
       "respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\n",
       "so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\n",
       "have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\n",
       "been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\n",
       "long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\n",
       "would have renounced their own home for Hartfield!  And who but Mr.\n",
       "Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an\n",
       "arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\n",
       "Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for\n",
       "a marriage between Frank and Emma.  How to settle the claims of\n",
       "Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less\n",
       "acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself--but even he had never been\n",
       "able to finish the subject better than by saying--\"Those matters will\n",
       "take care of themselves; the young people will find a way.\"  But here\n",
       "there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the\n",
       "future.  It was all right, all open, all equal.  No sacrifice on any\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\n",
       "as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.  If any thing\n",
       "could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon\n",
       "have outgrown its first set of caps.\n",
       "\n",
       "The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\n",

       "familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.-- He saw the advantages\n",
       "of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife;\n",
       "but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour\n",
       "he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\n",

       "of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\n",
       "afterwards.  It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\n",
       "had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon\n",
       "it would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the\n",
       "evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\n",

       "their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John\n",
       "Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their\n",
       "servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection\n",
       "raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize\n",
       "was not softened by any satisfaction.  Mr. Elton cared little about it,\n",
       "compared with his wife; he only hoped \"the young lady's pride would now\n",
       "be contented;\" and supposed \"she had always meant to catch Knightley if\n",
       "she could;\" and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly\n",
       "exclaim, \"Rather he than I!\"-- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed\n",
       "indeed.--\"Poor Knightley!  poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was\n",
       "extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\n",
       "qualities.-- How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in\n",
       "love--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\n",
       "pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\n",
       "with them whenever they asked him!  But that would be all over now.--\n",
       "Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_.  Oh!\n",
       "no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\n",
       "thing.--Extremely disagreeable!  But she was not at all sorry that she\n",
       "had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living\n",
       "together.  It would never do.  She knew a family near Maple Grove who\n",

       "Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her\n",
       "eyes, in eager gaze, said, \"No, this is impossible!\" but her lips were\n",
       "closed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is so, indeed,\" continued Mr. Knightley; \"I have it from Robert\n",
       "Martin himself.  He left me not half an hour ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\n",
       "the same.  But in time they will.  Time, you may be sure, will make one\n",
       "or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need\n",
       "not talk much on the subject.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,\" she replied, exerting herself.\n",
       "\"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\n",
       "cannot believe it.  It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,\n",
       "that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.  You cannot mean that he\n",
       "has even proposed to her again--yet.  You only mean, that he intends\n",
       "it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mean that he has done it,\" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\n",
       "determined decision, \"and been accepted.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good God!\" she cried.--\"Well!\"--Then having recourse to her\n",
       "workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the\n",
       "exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must\n",
       "be expressing, she added, \"Well, now tell me every thing; make this\n",
       "intelligible to me.  How, where, when?--Let me know it all.  I never\n",
       "was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure\n",
       "you.--How--how has it been possible?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a very simple story.  He went to town on business three days\n",
       "ago, and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to\n",
       "send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and\n",
       "was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's.\n",
       "They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was\n",
       "to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.  My friend\n",
       "Robert could not resist.  They called for him in their way; were all\n",
       "extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next\n",
       "day--which he did--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he\n",
       "found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not\n",
       "speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\n",
       "deserving.  He came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this\n",
       "morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\n",
       "on my affairs, and then on his own.  This is all that I can relate of\n",
       "the how, where, and when.  Your friend Harriet will make a much longer\n",
       "history when you see her.-- She will give you all the minute\n",
       "particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our\n",
       "communications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that\n",
       "Robert Martin's heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing;\n",
       "and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on\n",
       "quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John\n",
       "Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\n",
       "and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\n",
       "rather uneasy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.  To speak, she\n",
       "was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\n",
       "She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.  Her silence\n",
       "disturbed him; and after observing her a little while, he added,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\n",
       "unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.  His\n",
       "situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your\n",
       "friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him as\n",
       "you know him more.  His good sense and good principles would delight\n",
       "you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in\n",
       "better hands.  His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\n",
       "saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William\n",
       "Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\n",
       "to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.  I think\n",
       "Harriet is doing extremely well.  _Her_ connexions may be worse than\n",
       "_his_.  In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\n",
       "are.  I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.  You\n",
       "cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly\n",
       "unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more\n",
       "determined against him, much more, than she was before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You ought to know your friend best,\" replied Mr. Knightley; \"but I\n",
       "should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\n",
       "very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma could not help laughing as she answered, \"Upon my word, I believe\n",
       "you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you\n",
       "perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.  I\n",
       "could suppose she might in time--but can she already?-- Did not you\n",
       "misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business,\n",
       "shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of\n",
       "so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet's hand that he was\n",
       "certain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and\n",
       "Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so\n",
       "strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on\n",
       "Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such\n",
       "emphasis, \"No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,\"\n",
       "that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some\n",
       "measure, premature.  It could not be otherwise.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you dare say this?\" cried Mr. Knightley.  \"Do you dare to suppose\n",
       "me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--\n",
       "What do you deserve?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!  I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\n",
       "any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer.\n",
       "Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin\n",
       "and Harriet now are?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am quite sure,\" he replied, speaking very distinctly, \"that he told\n",
       "me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\n",
       "doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\n",
       "it must be so.  He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do.  He\n",
       "knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information\n",
       "of her relations or friends.  Could I mention any thing more fit to be\n",
       "done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?  I assured him that I could not.\n",
       "Then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am perfectly satisfied,\" replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\n",
       "\"and most sincerely wish them happy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\n",
       "Harriet's good qualities.  I have taken some pains for your sake, and\n",
       "for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as\n",
       "much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.  I have\n",
       "often talked to her a good deal.  You must have seen that I did.\n",
       "Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of\n",
       "pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all\n",
       "my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,\n",
       "with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her\n",
       "happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.-- Much of\n",
       "this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Me!\" cried Emma, shaking her head.--\"Ah! poor Harriet!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\n",
       "praise than she deserved.\n",
       "\n",
       "Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\n",
       "father.  She was not sorry.  She wanted to be alone.  Her mind was in a\n",
       "state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\n",
       "collected.  She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till\n",
       "she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected,\n",
       "she could be fit for nothing rational.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the\n",
       "horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\n",
       "had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\n",
       "imagined.  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\n",
       "Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\n",
       "security.--What had she to wish for?  Nothing, but to grow more worthy\n",
       "of him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her\n",
       "own.  Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her\n",
       "humility and circumspection in future.\n",
       "\n",
       "Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\n",
       "resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\n",
       "very midst of them.  She must laugh at such a close!  Such an end of\n",
       "the doleful disappointment of five weeks back!  Such a heart--such a\n",
       "Harriet!\n",
       "\n",
       "Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be a\n",
       "pleasure.  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\n",
       "\n",
       "High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\n",
       "reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\n",
       "soon be over.  The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her\n",
       "to practise, might soon be over.  She could now look forward to giving\n",
       "him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most\n",
       "ready to welcome as a duty.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\n",
       "always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\n",
       "speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being\n",
       "obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\n",
       "disappointed.\n",
       "\n",
       "They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly\n",
       "had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks\n",
       "for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\n",
       "blind, of two figures passing near the window.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\" said Mrs. Weston.  \"I was just going to\n",
       "tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning.\n",
       "He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend\n",
       "the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In half a minute they were in the room.  Emma was extremely glad to see\n",
       "him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing\n",
       "recollections on each side.  They met readily and smiling, but with a\n",
       "consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\n",
       "sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle,\n",
       "that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had\n",
       "long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with\n",
       "Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.  When Mr. Weston joined\n",
       "the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer\n",
       "a want of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for\n",
       "Frank Churchill to draw near her and say,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\n",
       "in one of Mrs. Weston's letters.  I hope time has not made you less\n",
       "willing to pardon.  I hope you do not retract what you then said.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, indeed,\" cried Emma, most happy to begin, \"not in the least.  I am\n",
       "particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy\n",
       "in person.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak\n",
       "with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is not she looking well?\" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\n",
       "\"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs.\n",
       "Weston doat upon her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\n",
       "mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\n",
       "Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can never think of it,\" she cried, \"without extreme shame.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The shame,\" he answered, \"is all mine, or ought to be.  But is it\n",
       "possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.  Early, I know,\n",
       "you had none.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I never had the smallest, I assure you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That appears quite wonderful.  I was once very near--and I wish I\n",
       "had--it would have been better.  But though I was always doing wrong\n",
       "things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no\n",
       "service.-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken\n",
       "the bond of secrecy and told you every thing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is not now worth a regret,\" said Emma.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have some hope,\" resumed he, \"of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a\n",
       "visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.  When the\n",
       "Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue\n",
       "there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at such\n",
       "a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?-- Till this\n",
       "morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.  Do not\n",
       "you pity me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\n",
       "thought, he cried,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah! by the bye,\" then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\n",
       "moment--\"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\"  He paused.--She coloured and\n",
       "laughed.--\"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\n",
       "in your favour.  Let me return your congratulations.-- I assure you\n",
       "that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and\n",
       "satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\n",
       "his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\n",
       "and his next words were,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and\n",
       "yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.  It is a\n",
       "most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--a most\n",
       "distinguishing complexion!  So peculiarly the lady in it.-- Just colour\n",
       "enough for beauty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have always admired her complexion,\" replied Emma, archly; \"but do\n",
       "not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\n",
       "pale?-- When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not\n",
       "help saying,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\n",
       "had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.-- I am\n",
       "sure it was a consolation to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?  I was the\n",
       "most miserable wretch!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.  I am sure it was\n",
       "a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\n",
       "all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\n",
       "truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\n",
       "situation.  I think there is a little likeness between us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He bowed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If not in our dispositions,\" she presently added, with a look of true\n",
       "sensibility, \"there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which\n",
       "bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our\n",
       "own.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"True, true,\" he answered, warmly.  \"No, not true on your side.  You\n",
       "can have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.\n",
       "Look at her.  Is not she an angel in every gesture?  Observe the turn\n",
       "of her throat.  Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--\n",
       "You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)\n",
       "that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels.  They are to be\n",
       "new set.  I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.  Will\n",
       "not it be beautiful in her dark hair?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very beautiful, indeed,\" replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that\n",
       "he gratefully burst out,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\n",
       "looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.  I should\n",
       "certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\n",
       "of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\n",
       "infant's appearing not quite well.  She believed she had been foolish,\n",
       "but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of\n",
       "sending for Mr. Perry.  Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston\n",
       "had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the\n",
       "child had been perfectly well again.  This was her history; and\n",
       "particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her\n",
       "very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that\n",
       "she had not done it.  \"She should always send for Perry, if the child\n",
       "appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.\n",
       "She could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often.  It\n",
       "was a pity, perhaps, that he had not come last night; for, though the\n",
       "child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have\n",
       "been better if Perry had seen it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frank Churchill caught the name.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perry!\" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\n",
       "Fairfax's eye.  \"My friend Mr. Perry!  What are they saying about Mr.\n",
       "Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel\n",
       "now?--Has he set up his carriage?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\n",
       "laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she too was really\n",
       "hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!\" he cried.  \"I can never think of\n",

       "attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\n",
       "unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\n",
       "recurrence of any such uncertainty.  A very few days brought the party\n",
       "from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\n",
       "alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable\n",
       "as it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr.\n",
       "Knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\n",
       "but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\n",
       "self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\n",
       "the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\n",
       "fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend's\n",
       "approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\n",
       "meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.-- Harriet was\n",
       "most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the\n",
       "dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\n",
       "But what did such particulars explain?-- The fact was, as Emma could\n",
       "now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that\n",
       "his continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must\n",
       "ever be unintelligible to Emma.\n",
       "\n",
       "The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\n",
       "reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.  She proved\n",
       "to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\n",
       "comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\n",
       "have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility\n",
       "which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!-- It was likely to\n",
       "be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman:  but what a\n",
       "connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the\n",
       "Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!-- The stain of illegitimacy,\n",
       "unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated\n",
       "liberally; it was all as it should be:  and as Emma became acquainted\n",
       "with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\n",
       "acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\n",
       "bid fairest for her little friend.  She had no doubt of Harriet's\n",
       "happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\n",
       "offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\n",
       "improvement.  She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\n",
       "and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and\n",
       "occupied enough for cheerfulness.  She would be never led into\n",
       "temptation, nor left for it to find her out.  She would be respectable\n",
       "and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\n",
       "world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\n",
       "man;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\n",
       "was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.-- The\n",
       "intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\n",
       "into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and\n",
       "must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\n",
       "manner.\n",

       "Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\n",
       "her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\n",
       "no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\n",
       "could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr.\n",
       "Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall\n",
       "on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged\n",
       "of the three, were the first to be married.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\n",
       "comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\n",

       "to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\n",
       "allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\n",
       "the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\n",

       "to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\n",
       "distant event.\n",
       "\n",
       "When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\n",
       "almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.-- He began\n",
       "to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--a very\n",
       "promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.  Still, however,\n",
       "he was not happy.  Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his\n",
       "daughter's courage failed.  She could not bear to see him suffering, to\n",
       "know him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding\n",
       "almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that\n",

       "illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his\n",
       "nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\n",
       "way.-- Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\n",
       "turkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man.  Other poultry-yards in the\n",
       "neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\n",
       "Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\n",
       "son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\n",
       "night of his life.  The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of\n",
       "the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.  While either of\n",
       "them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.-- But Mr. John\n",
       "Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in\n",
       "November.\n",
       "\n",
       "The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\n",
       "cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\n",
       "moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called\n",
       "on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\n",
